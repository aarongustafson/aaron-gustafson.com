The goals of this extension are pretty straightforward:

1. Create the code we know we need and only that code;
2. Omit any code that we "might" need in the future;
3. Work for Angular, React, Vue, plain old JavaScript; and
4. Provide simple and functional steps to create a PWA on the major platforms listed above.

Nice.
