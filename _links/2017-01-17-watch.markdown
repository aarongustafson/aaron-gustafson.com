Very interesting perspective video showing how Master Chef winner (and blind chef) Christine Ha cooks. Vicarious experiences like this one can be very enlightening.

I love how she uses assistive tech like Amazon’s Echo as part of her cooking routine. I’ve found it invaluable for things like timers.
