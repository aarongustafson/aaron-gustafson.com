The famed Grey Lady has begun the shift to HTTPS. Their reasoning? It "helps protect the privacy of our readers and ensures the authenticity of our content."

This is very exciting!

So far, the following have been migrated:

- The NYTimes.com home page
- Articles published in 2014 and later
- Most section, column and topic pages
- The NYTimes.com mobile site
- Most blog pages
- TimesVideo
- Podcast pages

They are committed to moving all of NYTimes.com under HTTPS, but as we learned from the processes that other publications—The  Washington Post, Wired, BuzzFeed, The Guardian—it can take time and it can also be quite painful.

We thank them for doing it though.
