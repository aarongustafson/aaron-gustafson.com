A while back I joined [a Twitter conversation between Jared Spool and Jake Archibald about privacy policies](https://twitter.com/jmspool/status/638681563824279552) and shared my enthusiasm for how delicately Microsoft (my employer) treats any data it collects. I’m so happy to see Microsoft starting to open up a little more about what telemetry data they are collecting and how it is actually being used to make Windows better. To wit:

> [C]ertain combinations of audio drivers and audio hardware were resulting in audio that was broken or missing certain special effects. The telemetry data enabled the exact pairings of drivers and hardware that had issues to be pinpointed, enabling a fix to be developed.
