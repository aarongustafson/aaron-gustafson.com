I had the great pleasure of delivering the following talk at the [Edge Web Summit](https://web.archive.org/web/http://lanyrd.com/2016/edgesummit/) on April 4th. The talk is largely about accessibility with a push for thinking about the future of the interface and how considering accessibility now will help us prepare for a world of "headless UIs".
