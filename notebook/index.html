	<div class="entry__content">
		<p>Earlier today, <a href="http://www.kryogenix.org">Stuart Langridge</a>—who I worked with on WaSP’s DOM Scripting Task Force and have the utmost respect for—<a href="http://www.kryogenix.org/days/2014/09/19/fundamentally-connected/">published a blog response</a> to <a href="http://aaron-gustafson.com/notebook/2014/a-fundamental-disconnect/">my last post</a>. In it, he made some good points I wanted to highlight, but he also misunderstood one thing I said and managed to avoid addressing the core of my argument. As comments aren’t enabled on his site, I thought I’d respond here.</p>

<p>Let’s start with the good stuff:</p>

<blockquote><p>Now, nobody is arguing that the web environment is occasionally challengingly different across browsers and devices. But a lot of it isn’t. No browser ships with a JavaScript implementation in which 1 and 1 add to make 3, or in which Arrays don’t have a length property, or in which the for keyword doesn’t exist. If we ignore some of the Mozilla-specific stuff which is becoming ES6 (things such as array comprehensions, which nobody is actually using in actual live code out there in the universe), JavaScript is pretty stable and pretty unchanging across all its implementations. Of course, what we’re really talking about here is the DOM model, not JavaScript-the-language, and to claim that “JavaScript can be the virtual machine” and then say “aha I didn’t mean the DOM” is sophistry on a par with a child asking “can I not not not not not have an ice-cream?”. But the DOM model is pretty stable too, let’s be honest. In things I build, certainly I find myself in murky depths occasionally with JavaScript across different browsers and devices, but those depths are as the sparkling waters of Lake Treviso by comparison with CSS across different browsers. In fact, when CSS proves problematic across browsers, JavaScript is the bandage used to fix it and provide a consistent experience — your keyframed CSS animation might be unreliable, but jQuery plugins work everywhere. JavaScript is the glue that binds the other bits together.</p></blockquote>

<p>To be honest, I could not agree more, nor could I put it more elegantly. JavaScript, as a language, is relatively stable in terms of its core API. Sure, there are some gaps that JavaScript libraries have always sought to even out, but by and large what works in one browser will work in another. Assuming, of course, JavaScript is available… but let’s come back to that.</p>

<p>In this passage Stuart also highlights the quagmire that is CSS support. This is a great point to hammer home: we have no assurance that the CSS we write will be understood by or interpreted the same in every browser. This is why it is so important that we provide fallbacks like a hex value for that RGBa color we want to use. It pays have a solid understanding of how fault tolerance works because it helps us author the most robust code and ultimately leads to fewer browser headaches (and happier users). I devoted a huge portion of the CSS chapter in <a href="http://adaptivewebdesign.info">my book</a> to the topic.</p>

<p>I also loved this passage:</p>

<blockquote><p>Web developers are actually better than non-web developers. And Aaron explains precisely why. It is because to build a great web app is precisely to build a thing which can be meaningfully experienced by people on any class of browser and device and capability. The absolute tip-top very best “native” app can only be enjoyed by those to whom it is native. “Native apps” are poetry: undeniably beautiful when done well, but useless if you don’t speak the language. A great web app, on the other hand, is a painting: beautiful to experience and available to everybody. The Web has trained its developers to attempt to build something that is fundamentally egalitarian, fundamentally available to everyone. That’s why the Web’s good. The old software model, of something which only works in one place, isn’t the baseline against which the Web should be judged; it’s something that’s been surpassed. Software development is easiest if it only has to work on your own machine, but that doesn’t mean that that’s all we should aim for. We’re all still collaboratively working out exactly how to build apps this way. Do we always succeed? No. But by any measure the Web is the largest, most widely deployed, most popular and most ubiquitous computing platform the world has ever known. And its programming language is JavaScript.</p></blockquote>

<p>I’ll admit I got a little teary-eyed when he said <q>The Web has trained its developers to attempt to build something that is fundamentally egalitarian, fundamentally available to everyone.</q>. Stuart is bang on with this passage. Building the Web requires more of us than traditionally software development. In many ways, it asks us to be our best selves.</p>

<p>The one thing I take issue with is that last sentence, but again, I’ll come back to it.</p>

<p>In the middle, his post got a little off-track. Most likely it was because I was not as clear in my post as I could have been:</p>

<blockquote><p>I am not at all sold that “we have knowledge of [the server environment] and can author your program accordingly so it will execute as anticipated” when doing server development. Or, at least, that’s possible, but nobody does. If you doubt this, I invite you to go file a bug on any server-side app you like and say “this thing doesn’t work right for me” and then add at the bottom “oh, and I’m running FreeBSD, not Ubuntu”. The response will occasionally be “oh really? we had better get that fixed then!” but is much more likely to be “we don’t support that. Use Ubuntu and this git repository.” Now, that’s a valid approach — we only support this specific known configuration! — but importantly, on the web Aaron sees requiring a specific browser/OS combination as an impractical impossibility and the wrong thing to do, whereas doing this on the server is positively virtuous. I believe that this is no virtue. Dismissing claims of failure with “well, you should be using the environment I demand” is just as large a sin on the server or the desktop as it is in the browser. You, the web developer, can’t require that I use your choice of browser, but equally you, the server developer, shouldn’t require that I use your particular exact combination of server packages either. Why do client users deserve more respect than server users? If a developer using your server software should be compelled to go and get a different server, how’s that different from asking someone to install a different web browser? Sure, I’m not expecting someone who built a server app running on Linux to necessarily also make it run on Windows (although wise developers will do so), but then I’m not really expecting someone who’s built a 3d game with WebGL to make the experience meaningful for someone browsing with Lynx, either.</p></blockquote>

<p>Here’s what he was reacting to:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>If we’re writing server-side software in Python or Rails or even PHP, one of two things is true:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>We control the server environment: operating system, language versions, packages, etc.; or</li>
        <li>We don’t control the server environment, but we have knowledge of it and can author your program accordingly so it will execute as anticipated.</li>
    </ol>
</blockquote>


<p>In this passage, I was talking about software we write for ourselves, our companies, and our clients. In those cases we do—or at least we <em>should</em>—know the environment our code is running in and can customize our code or the server build if a particular package or feature is missing. In fact, this is such a consistent need that we now have umpteen tools that empower us make recipes of server requirements so we can quickly build, configure, and deploy servers right from the command line. I would never write server-side code for a client running Windows without testing it on a carbon-copy of their Windows server. That would be reckless and unprofessional.</p>

<p>If, however, I was writing code to sell or license to third parties, I’d fall into the second camp I outlined:</p>

<blockquote><p>In the more traditional installed software world, we can similarly control the environment by placing certain restrictions on what operating systems our code can run on and what the dependencies for its use may be in terms of hard drive space and RAM required. We provide that information up front and users can choose to use our software or use a competing product based on what will work for them.</p></blockquote>

<p>Lots of people who offer software in this way provide an overview of hardware and software requirements for using their product, and that’s fine. But I feel Stuart was incorrectly lumping the two camps together. He asks “Why do client users deserve more respect than server users?” I agree with the sentiment—the lack of requirements documentation for some third party server utilities is certainly appalling—but if I choose to try installing a given utility or program without knowing if it will work on my system, that’s my choice. And, moreover, failing installs of server-side utilities is a concern that I—a technical-savvy software developer—can readily deal with (or at least that I am competent enough to solve with Google’s help). I don’t think we can expect the same of the people who read our content, check their bank balances on our systems, and whose experience and capabilities may not be the same as ours.</p>

<p>Stuart brings his response to a close with the gloriously uplifting statement—<q>[B]y any measure the Web is the largest, most widely deployed, most popular and most ubiquitous computing platform the world has ever known.</q>—before declaring, unequivocally, <q>[I]ts programming language is JavaScript.</q> That sounds great, but it’s not entirely true.</p>

<p>The first part is dead-on: the Web absolutely is <q>most popular and most ubiquitous computing platform the world has ever known</q>, but saying that the Web’s only programming language is JavaScript is a bit disingenuous. Yes, JavaScript is the de-facto programming language in the browser, but that’s only half of the equation: PHP, Perl, C++, Ruby, Java, Python… these (and many others) are the languages that drive the vast majority of the server-side processing that makes the dynamic Web possible. (Yes, JavaScript has made it onto the server side of things, but I don’t think that was what he was trying to say. Stuart, please correct me if I’m wrong.) These languages provide a fallback when JavaScript fails us. We need them.</p>

<p>The fact is that you can’t build a robust Web experience that relies solely on client-side JavaScript. And that’s what disappointed me about Stuart’s post: he completely avoided addressing this, the main thrust of my argument. While JavaScript may technically be available and consistently-implemented across most devices used to access our sites nowadays, we do not control how, when, or even if that JavaScript is ultimately executed. That’s the disconnect.</p>

<p>Any number of factors can bring our carefully-crafted JavaScript application to its knees. I mentioned a few in my post, but I’ll reiterate them here, along with a few others:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Bugs</strong>: None of us write buggy code, of course, but even if we did, we have numerous safeguards that would prohibit that buggy code from making it into production. <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2011/02/07/gawker-outage-causing-twitter-stir/">Right? Right!?</a> But what about third-party code? I have gotten a buggy version of jQuery from the Google Ajax CDN before. And I’ve certainly come across buggy jQuery plugins. And what about the JavaScript being injected by other third party services? Advertising networks… social widgets… we test all of that code too, right? Any errors or conflicts in JavaScript code can cause all JavaScript execution to stop.</li>
<li><strong>Browser Add-ons</strong>: We can’t control which add-ons or plugins our users have installed on their browser, but each and every one has the ability to manipulate the DOM, insert CSS, and inject scripts. If we don’t code defensively, we can spend hours trying to replicate a bug report only to ultimately discover the person reporting it had an add-on installed that was causing the issue. I’ve been there. It sucks.</li>
<li><strong>Man-in-the-Middle Attacks</strong>: Back in the olden days, we used to have to worry about JavaScript being blocked at the firewall as a security threat. That issue has largely gone away, but we still run into similar issues today: Sky accidentally blocked jQuery for all of their UK subscribers when they <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jan/28/sky-broadband-blocks-jquery-web-critical-plugin">mistakenly flagged the hosted version of jQuery as malware and filtered it out</a>. And routers are capable of injecting code that can break our pages too: <a href="http://aaron-gustafson.com/notebook/2014/the-network-effect/">I wrote about Comcast doing it the other day</a> and then experienced a similar issue with the Atlanta airport’s free Wi-Fi while on my way home from BlendConf. Sadly, unless we send everything via SSL, we can’t even control what code ultimately gets delivered to our users.</li>
<li><strong>Underpowered Hardware</strong>: Some devices just don’t have the RAM to store or processing power to execute large JavaScript frameworks. If we’re using one, we could be dead in the water. Oh, and iOS sandboxes in-app browsers and <a href="http://sealedabstract.com/rants/why-mobile-web-apps-are-slow/">they run really slowly</a> compared to the native Safari browser (which is already pretty slow compared to desktop browsers). If someone opens a link to our site in the Twitter app or if we are using a native app wrapper around our Web experience, the whole thing may… just… crawl.</li>
<li><strong>Still Loading</strong>: While our JavaScript is being downloaded, processed, and executed, it’s not running. So, if JavaScript is a requirement for any interaction, the site could appear frozen until the browser finishes dealing with it.</li>
</ol>


<p>All of this adds up to JavaScript being the biggest potential single point of failure in our Web experience.</p>

<p>Again, it’s not that JavaScript is a bad thing; I love JavaScript and write it every day—some days it’s all I do. But when we write JavaScript, its critical that we recognize that we can’t be guaranteed it will run. We need a backup plan and that’s what progressive enhancement asks of us. If we do that, our bases are covered and we can sleep soundly knowing that our users are happy because they can do what they need to do, no matter what.</p>

<p>And I, for one, enjoy sleeping.</p>

	<div class="entry__content">
		<p>Yesterday at <a href="//2014.blendconf.com/">BlendConf</a>, <a href="//www.hanselman.com/">Scott Hanselman</a> gave a fantastically-entertaining keynote entitled “JavaScript, The Cloud, and the rise of the New Virtual Machine.” In it, he chronicled all of the ways Web development and deployment has changed—for the better—over the years. He also boldly declared that JavaScript is now, effectively, a virtual machine in the browser.</p>

<p>This is a topic that has been weighing on my mind for quite some time now. I’ll start by saying that I’m a big fan of JavaScript. I write a lot of it and I find it incredibly useful, both as a programming language and as a way to improve the usability and accessibility of content on the Web. That said, I know its limitations. But I’ll get to that in a minute.</p>

<p>In the early days of the Web, “proper” software developers shied away from JavaScript. Many viewed it as a “toy” language (and felt similarly about HTML and CSS). It wasn’t as powerful as Java or Perl or C in their minds, so it wasn’t really worth learning. In the intervening years, however, JavaScript has changed a lot.</p>

<p>Most of these developers first began taking JavaScript seriously in the mid ’00s when Ajax became popular. And with the rise of JavaScript MVC frameworks and their ilk—Angular, Ember, etc.—many of these developers made their way onto the Web. I would argue that this, overall, is a good thing: We need more people working on the Web to make it better.</p>

<p>The one problem I’ve seen, however, is the fundamental disconnect many of these developers seem to have with the way deploying code on the Web works. In traditional software development, we have some say in the execution environment. On the Web, we don’t.</p>

<p>I’ll explain.</p>

<p>If we’re writing server-side software in Python or Rails or even PHP, one of two things is true:</p>

<ol>
<li>We control the server environment: operating system, language versions, packages, etc.; or</li>
<li>We don’t control the server environment, but we have knowledge of it and can author your program accordingly so it will execute as anticipated.</li>
</ol>


<p>In the more traditional installed software world, we can similarly control the environment by placing certain restrictions on what operating systems our code can run on and what the dependencies for its use may be in terms of hard drive space and RAM required. We provide that information up front and users can choose to use our software or use a competing product based on what will work for them.</p>

<p>On the Web, however, all bets are off. The Web is ubiquitous. The Web is messy. And, as much as we might like to control a user’s experience down to the very pixel, those of us who have been working on the Web for a while understand that it’s a fool’s errand and <a href="//dowebsitesneedtolookexactlythesameineverybrowser.com/">have adjusted our expectations accordingly</a>. Unfortunately, this new crop of Web developers doesn’t seem to have gotten that memo.</p>

<p>We do not control the environment executing our JavaScript code, interpreting our HTML, or applying our CSS. Our users control the device (and, thereby, its processor speed, RAM, etc.). Our users choose the operating system. Our users pick the browser and which version they use. Our users can decide which add-ons they put in the browser. Our users can shrink or enlarge the fonts used to display our Web pages and apps. And the Internet providers that sit between us and our users, dictating the network speed, latency, and ultimately <a href="//aaron-gustafson.com/notebook/2014/the-network-effect/">controlling how—and what part of—our content makes it to our users</a>.</p>

<p>All we can do is author a compelling, adaptive experience, cross our fingers, and hope for the best.</p>

<p>The fundamental problem with viewing JavaScript as the new VM is that it creates the illusion of control. Sure, if we are building an internal Web app, we might be able to dictate the OS/browser combination for all of our users and lock down their machines to prevent them from modifying those settings, but that’s not the reality on the open Web.</p>

<p>The fact is that we can’t absolutely rely on the availability of any specific technology when it comes to delivering a Web experience. Instead, we must look at <em>how</em> we construct that experience and make smarter decisions about how we use specific technologies in order to take advantage of their benefits while simultaneously understanding that their availability is not guaranteed. This is why progressive enhancement is such a useful philosophy.</p>

<p>The history of the Web is littered with JavaScript disaster stories. That doesn’t mean we shouldn’t use JavaScript or that it’s inherently bad. It simply means we need to be smarter about our approach to JavaScript and build robust experiences that allow users to do what they need to do even quickly an easily even if our carefully-crafted, incredibly well-designed JavaScript-driven interface won’t run.</p>

	<div class="entry__content">
		<p><cite>Ars Technica</cite> revealed today that <a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2014/09/why-comcasts-javascript-ad-injections-threaten-security-net-neutrality/">Comcast is injecting self-promotional advertising into web pages delivered via it’s Wi-Fi hotspots</a>:</p>

<blockquote cite="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2014/09/why-comcasts-javascript-ad-injections-threaten-security-net-neutrality/">
    <p>A Comcast spokesman told Ars the program began months ago. One facet of it is designed to alert consumers that they are connected to Comcast&#8217;s Xfinity service. Other ads remind Web surfers to download Xfinity apps, Comcast spokesman Charlie Douglas told Ars in telephone interviews.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>I wish I could say this is surprising, but it’s not: Any service that routes your content has the opportunity to modify the response being returned. Comcast is exploiting that opportunity and injecting JavaScript that, in turn, injects the ads.</p>

<p>The fact that middlemen can manipulate server responses is one reason <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBhZ6S0PFCY">Google is pushing for all sites to be served under HTTPS</a>. With traffic running to and from your server in an encrypted fashion, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack">man-in-the-middle attacks</a>—which, if we’re honest, is what this amounts to—become much more difficult.</p>

<p>Assuming you can’t run under HTTPS for one reason or another, how do you harden your <a href="https://adactio.com/journal/6246">web thang</a> against 3rd party manipulation you can’t control? What if Comcast’s JavaScript interferes with your own? Remember when <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jan/28/sky-broadband-blocks-jquery-web-critical-plugin">Sky blocked jQuery for all of their customers</a>? That was a bad couple of hours for most UK-based internet users.</p>

<p>Comcast’s move only serves to remind us—yet again—that we don’t control how our sites are delivered or what our users see. Or rather we do, but only up to a point. So rather than focus on some ideal experience we expect everyone to have, we must focus on building great experiences that work in a variety of contexts and situations.</p>

<p>We need to develop <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demolition_derby#Vehicles">the 1964 Chrysler Imperial</a> of websites: Sites that soldier on even when they are getting pummeled from all sides. After all, browsers, plug-ins, users, networks, and, yes, even the very routers that deliver our connections all have a say in how (and what) content gets to our users.</p>

<p>I’ll leave you with this scary quote from the <cite>Ars</cite> piece:</p>

<blockquote cite="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2014/09/why-comcasts-javascript-ad-injections-threaten-security-net-neutrality/">
    <p>Security expert Dan Kaminsky said in an e-mail that JavaScript injection has the potential to break “all sorts of stuff, in that you no longer know as a website developer precisely what code is running in browsers out there. You didn&#8217;t send it, but your customers received it.”</p>
</blockquote>


<p>Hooray!</p>

	<div class="entry__content">
		<p>In his astute post <a href="//www.brucelawson.co.uk/2014/native-experience-vs-styling-select-boxes/">“‘Native experience’ vs styling select boxes”</a>, Bruce Lawson correctly identified a common tension in the web world:</p>

<blockquote><p>But why this urge to re-style page elements that end-users are familiar with? … Or is it that we love native look and feel, except when we don’t?</p></blockquote>

<p>Speaking as the guy who not only wrote JavaScript to help me create an accessible <code>select</code> element alternative, but who also made it <a href="http://d1b14unh5d6w7g.cloudfront.net/1590598563.01.S0ER.LXXXXXXX.jpg?Expires=1405686346&amp;Signature=DCT4Z0l75JQESDNyP0PVGVonuJYwY9XYtaTI3grX/RhdlLcXGRAVADJCB/N/fAj7GxLhEVzuXqstMebJIJ9Ip5I6kE7IKYt2F20F5EGD+1ghua9zKwyjS1e4KBgumMKzQytbcfIVX4dMr7XFzj26mScFKz9bSKtZT5jU1LU6hWM=&amp;Key-Pair-Id=APKAIUO27P366FGALUMQ">the focus of a case study (image)</a> in <a href="http://amzn.to/TaoffD">AdvancED DOM Scripting</a>, I am fully aware of the desire to have it both ways. I have not often seen the desire for both in a single individual, but it does happen in one particular instance occasionally.</p>

<p>Based on my own experience, I see the following arguments in favor of changing the display of a native control quite often:</p>

<ol>
<li>It doesn’t look good to me.</li>
<li>It is not “on brand”.</li>
<li>It clashes with our brand’s color scheme.</li>
<li>We want the web experience to feel like a native app.</li>
<li>It doesn’t behave how we think it should.</li>
</ol>


<p><em>(<abbr lang="it" title="nota bene: please note">n.b.</abbr> Browsers have done a pretty good job reducing the amount of color and the overall visual strength used in native controls to help them better blend in with a wide variety of designs, so clashes as mentioned in #3 happen far less often than they did nearly a decade ago.)</em></p>

<p>As the weathered, battle tested (and, admittedly, somewhat jaded) front-end dev that I am, I typically push back with one or more of the following:</p>

<h2>In Addressing Desired Design Changes</h2>

<p>In terms of aesthetics (addressing arguments 1, 2, and 3), I understand where you’re coming from. Native controls are not the most appealing things, but they are familiar to your users. A <code>select</code> box they see on your site that looks like the one they see on Wikipedia or their banking site will be immediately recognizable. Sure, the looks and feel may differ from browser to browser, but most people use only a small number of browsers throughout the day—at work, at home, on their device—and if you want to ensure the design of a form control feels “right” in the browser they are using, sometimes it’s best to let go of that control.</p>

<h2>In Addressing OS Parity</h2>

<p>I can understand the desire to have a form control in a web page look and feel like the same (or a similar) control within the native operating system (argument 4), but I am not sure that’s a rabbit hole you want to go down. Here’s why: Achieving exact design and functional parity between a native control and a web control quite often requires extra markup, a bunch of CSS, and a bit of JavaScript. Anything is achievable with unlimited time and budget, so it’s completely doable, but it would be good to estimate the cost to see if you still think it is a worthwhile endeavor.</p>

<p>Assuming it is, we then have the question of which operating system to model the control after. Or maybe you want to offer a different take on the control based on the operating system your user is using. In that case, we may need to multiply the original estimate by the number of operating systems you want to support. But it’s worth noting that, in the Android world, different device manufacturers often “skin” the operating system to look different from other ones. Sometimes they even do it on a device-by-device basis. We’ll need to figure out which ones you want to include in your native control matrix and multiply the estimate accordingly.</p>

<p>Then there’s maintenance. We’ll need to test these native-like controls on each of their corresponding platforms and test the script that determines which experience gets delivered to which device to make sure we’re not accidentally sending the wrong experience. We’ll also need to test the delivery script on every other browser in our test matrix to ensure it is not causing issues there.</p>

<p>What should we do when a new operating system version is rolled out? iOS, for example, has made radical shifts in the design of their native controls in each major release. We’ll probably want to create unique versions of the control for each version of each OS we support and we’ll need to keep tabs on upgrades so we don’t end up confusing our users if they visit our site in iOS 7 and have a control that looks like it’s from iOS 6. We’ll need to add the number of OS versions into the multiplier as well.</p>

<p>Ok, and finally: How many controls did you want to apply this approach to again?</p>

<p>Or we could use the native form control and it will just work.</p>

<h2>In Addressing Altered Behavior</h2>

<p>I completely agree that not all native controls work exactly how I would like, but there are several risks in changing the expected behavior of a native control.</p>

<p>First of all, there’s the possibility we could actually end up making the interface more confusing or that the change in behavior might not be exactly what our user’s wanted (either based on what they are used to or our mental model not aligning with theirs). In order to rule out these issues, we should run a few rounds of usability tests. These could be quick café tests or more formal studies depending on the budget.</p>

<p>Assuming our tests go well, we will need to maintain this code and do all of the requisite browser testing. And potentially upgrade our code as new browsers and browser versions come out. Depending on the complexity of the code, this could become a large requirement, but if it is ultimately in the service of making the web a better, more usable interaction environment, it could be worth it.</p>

<p>For what it’s worth, if we go this route and are successful, we should consider getting involved in the spec-writing process at the <a href="//w3.org">W3C</a> or  <a href="//whatwg.org">WhatWG</a>. We should contribute our recommended changes back to the community and share what we learned. If we make a compelling argument, perhaps our idea will become part of some future standard and we can taper off our browser testing when the change goes native.</p>

<hr>


<p>As you can probably tell, I’m not a really big fan of changing existing controls as I feel it can amount to a wasted effort. That said, if there are design improvements to be made—“design” in the true sense: being about how usable something is, not just how aesthetically-pleasing it is to someone (e.g. improving contrast, making the control more intuitive, etc.)—I’m willing to accept the change as something we <em>should</em> do and then work to make sure that change has been vetted and, if successful, given away for inclusion in other projects. If it solves a major issue on the web, I want to give that change every opportunity to make it into the appropriate spec by talking to the appropriate folks about it both in-person, in blog posts, and on the appropriate mailing list. If the change solves a problem in a specific browser, I want to see it incorporated into said browser and will file a bug report and try to build momentum around it by engaging the community.</p>

<p>Anyway, that’s my general position on augmenting native controls. What are your thoughts on the topic?</p>

		<p>This <a href="http://www.wired.com/2014/07/what-a-stalling-tablet-market-says-about-our-search-for-the-perfect-screen/">recent piece from <cite>Wired</cite></a> attributes dwindling tablet sales to cannibalization from larger mobile phones (<abbr title="also known as">aka</abbr> “phablets”) which are nearly as big as 7-8˝ tablets:</p>

<blockquote><p>Aside from the ability to make a phone call, the difference between a phone and a tablet comes down to 1.5 inches or less. … But the real issue is device makers are running out of good arguments for why these ever more subtle size gradations matter. After a point, the differences come down to personal preference rather than any meaningful new use case. As phones and tablets converge into this tight window, slightly bigger phones could accelerate the decline in tablet demand.</p></blockquote>

<p>Personally, I’m not sure it matters. We’re in the midst of one big experiment being run by the device manufacturers. We’re in the scattershot. The industry is feeling out the &ldquo;right&rdquo; screen size (or sizes) that most people want to use and we are (in large part) footing the bill.</p>

	<div class="entry__content">
		<p>So, a mere three years after my old “life blog” stopped working, I decided to scrap it and start fresh.</p>

<p>In my quest to learn something new (more on that in a forthcoming post), I decided to give <a href="http://octopress.org">Octopress</a> a whirl. We’ll see how it goes, but the content entry has gone well so far and the Octopress community has been pretty responsive to my requests. I just need to get used to the workflow.</p>

<p>In the spirit of openness, I’ve decided to host the new site on <a href="http://github.com">Github</a> as a <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Page</a>. This frees me up from worrying about hosting fees of course, but it also means this site can serve as an educational tool for those inclined to dig in to the work I do and want some introspection into the way I do it. You can <a href="https://github.com/aarongustafson/aarongustafson.github.io/">view (and fork) the whole darn thing</a> at your leisure.</p>

<p>Finally, I’m designing and building this site in the open and, for posterity, taking screen shot of the progress. The screenshots will go up in time as an animated GIF, but those of you who wish will be able to follow along at home or work, seeing how I typically piece together a site, layer by layer, using <a href="http://adaptivewebdesign.info">progressive enhancement</a>. So far it’s just the content, but that’s what I preach: content first.</p>

<p>Now it’s time to get back to it. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions.</p>
