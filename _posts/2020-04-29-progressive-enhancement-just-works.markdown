In his most recent blog post, Manuel Matuzović offered a great case study covering how he built [Front-end Bookmarks](https://www.frontendbookmarks.com/).   In the course of developing it, Manuel found that following the progressive enhancement philosophy in his development made it easy to support older/less feature rich browsers and devices:

> To my surprise, I only had to reduce some paddings and font sizes to make it look nice. I didn’t have to change much because I follow the Progressive Enhancement principle when I build websites.

We saw [this same benefit back in 2013](https://blog.easy-designs.net/archives/the-true-cost-of-progressive-enhancement/). When adding support for 1,400 new mobile browser/device combos to a project built for iOS and Android, we exceeded even our own expectations and were able to cut the timeline and budget in half!

> It’s worth noting that this accomplishment had nothing to do with our bug-squashing prowess or our speed… progressive enhancement just works. We were dealing with some heinous old browsers too—think Blackberry 4 and OpenWave—and they really didn’t present much of a challenge. So, for a very modest sum, we were able to quickly roll out additional support for over 1000 devices (and probably thousands more that didn’t make the list) and that created a huge opportunity for our client to attract and retain new customers.

I’ve been working on the web for a long time and few development philosophies have proven as timeless and resilient as progressive enhancement.
