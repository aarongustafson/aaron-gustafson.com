I think we can all agree, [link rot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_rot) is a problem. A 2014 study by Harvard Law School determined that [roughly 50% of the URLs referenced in U.S. Supreme Court opinions no longer work](http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=9282809&fileId=S1472669614000255/). That’s *terrifying*.

When I was mid-way through writing [the Second Edition of <cite>Adaptive Web Design</cite>](http://adaptivewebdesign.info/2nd-edition/), I realized that it was pretty likely some of the links I was referencing might disappear over the years. Little did I know, some of them would disappear *while I was writing the book!*

[The Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine](https://archive.org/web/) is pretty good, but it doesn’t archive everything, and I often find captured pages end up broken—especially if they rely heavily JavaScript, but often images go missing as well. I wanted to make sure that when you pick up the book a year from now or even 10 years from now, the links will still work.

I evaluated a few options for creating a permanent archive of each and every link in the book (there are over 200), but then it dawned on me that [Perma.cc](https://perma.cc/) might be the perfect answer.

Perma.cc was created by the [Harvard Library Innovation Lab](http://librarylab.law.harvard.edu/) in reaction to the paper I mentioned earlier. It is a distributed archive of URLs for scholarly and legal documents, supported not only by Harvard, but over 90 (*and counting!*) libraries, distributed all over the world. [It’s also open source](https://github.com/harvard-lil/perma). Each [URL is preserved as a live view, an archived view, and a screen capture](https://perma.cc/docs#archive-formats) taken when the link is added. Archived URLs are kept for a minumum of 2 years, but [may be "vested" into the permanent archive by a member organization](https://perma.cc/docs#vesting-links).

I had contributed some CSS to the project a while back, so I reached out to my contacts to see if they might be interested in vesting all of the links for the book. Turns out they were big fans of [the First Edition](http://adaptivewebdesign.info/1st-edition/) and enthusiastically offered their support.

Converting all of the links took time (and a lot of double- and triple-checking), but the result is that every article, blog post, and web page that I referenced in the book will remain accessible to you in perpetuity. I think that’s pretty awesome. And, as an added bonus, since Perma.cc creates unique URLs that are relatively short, those of you who read it in print won't have to re-type the often incredibly-lengthy original URLs.

I can’t thank [Matt Phillips](http://mattphillips.info/), [Adam Ziegler](https://twitter.com/abziegler), [Jack Cushman](http://jackcushman.org/), and everyone else at the Harvard Library Innovation Lab enough for creating Perma.cc *and* for offering their service to my readers. You all are amazing!
