Almost two years ago, Kelly bought me my first salt water aquarium as an anniversary present. While awesome in any sense, the gift was particularly special to me because of my history with the ocean.

I <abbr title="self contained underwater breathing apparatus">scuba</abbr> dived for the very first time when I was 13. I was immediately hooked. I started diving at every opportunity I had, got PADI certified in Junior Open Water, Open Water, Advanced Open Water, and Rescue Diver by the time I was 16.

Unfortunately, a few short months after becoming a certified rescue diver (one step away from Dive Master), I accidentally punctured my eardrum with a cotton swab and lost 70% of my right tympanum.  Despite undergoing a tympanoplasty to patch the hole in my ear, the hole persisted and my diving career ended abruptly.

At the time, I had planned to go to college for marine biology with a focus on icthyology, specifically sharks. I left for New College the next year in pursuit of that field of study but over the course of two years, my interest in the subject waned as I dealt with the reality that I would not dive again. I eventually pivoted into journalism and eventually ended up working on the web. But my love of the sea and all of her wonders never left me.

Back when I was in high school and college, keeping a reef tank was quite difficult and in order to keep a healthy reef you needed untold thousands of dollars and a lot of patience. On top of that, a lot of the corals were necessarily sourced from the wild and came with poor survivability rates.

A lot has changed.

Lighting capable of sustaining and growing traditionally difficult small polyp stony (SPS) corals like <i class="taxonomy genus">Acropora</i> and <i class="taxonomy genus">Montipora</i> is easily available, affordable, and (in many cases) is energy efficient in the form of LEDs. Filtration has come a long way as well as we’ve come to better understand the Nitrogen cycle, mechanical, and biological filtration methods. And the tanks themselves have increased in quality while simultaneously becoming much more affordable as well.

When Kelly got me the reef tank, it reignited my passion for the sea and I began to geek out over everything reef related.

Having been a veteran of fresh water aquaria, I knew a lot about keeping fish, but very little about keeping a coral colony alive. That said, I was eager to learn as I had always marveled at the reefs I dove off of Grand Cayman and was looking forward to giving it my all.

What really amazed me about reef keeping was how self-sustaining it is as an industry. Obviously every reef keeper wants to show of his or her beautifully aquascaped reef tank, but beyond the pride seen in tank design, there is an incredible focus on growing out coral colonies and sharing them with others. Propagation is a big part of the reef hobby and was not something that was particularly easy in the world of freshwater fish.

It seems that as reef keepers were able to improve survivability of wild-collected colonies through better understanding of the science of reefs and better technology, the hobby has largely been able to move away from being purely collection-based to a more self-sustaining model dealing in aquacultured (i.e. tank grown) or maricultured (i.e. ocean farmed) “frags”. Frags are coral fragments of an inch or more of healthy tissue which can be grown into a substantial specimen in a few years (or sometimes only a few months).

Through this practice, the global reef keeping hobby has reduced collection pressure on wild colonies and in some cases actually saved reef species that would be destroyed by damaging environmental practices like dredging. While there are certainly some exceptions, I would argue that reef keepers are environmentalists and want nothing more than to see the wild reef thrive. In fact, their personal coral gardens are an homage to the wild reefs that are being threatened at a much larger scale by industries and governments with far greater capacity for damage than even the meager amount of wild coral collection that continues to occur.

Reef keepers create connections between us and the ocean, providing a window into a world that is often quite hard to picture, even when gazing across the water with our feet sinking into a pristine white sand-blasted beach.

Since starting up my small 29 gallon BioCube, I have introduced over 30 coral varieties across nearly a dozen different genera. Some were sourced form my local fish store, some I picked up from other stores while traveling, and still others were purchased via the Internet from other reef keepers. In two years, I have successfully propagated more than a third of the corals and sold or swapped frags with other reef keepers, aquaculture facilities, and fish stores.
