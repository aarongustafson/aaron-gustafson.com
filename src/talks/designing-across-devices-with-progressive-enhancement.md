Remember the good old days when getting IE6 to “work” was our main worry?

My, we’ve come a long way, baby.

Today, browsers are just one of the issues among a sea of considerations like accessibility, device compatibility, and responsive or adaptive design. And with new techniques and devices coming out daily, it’s easy to feel overwhelmed.

Fortunately, I know how to wrangle all of these elements using progressive enhancement. With his practical approach, he designs for humans on any spectrum ­­ with and without javascript enabled—and soon enough, you will, too.

Create experiences without technological constraints

* Understand progressive enhancement and integrate it with your process
* Use content as your foundation and build the experience from there

Stop assuming users are just like you

* Come to a better understanding of how existing design decisions can unintentionally skew your analytics
* Prevent the typical myopic view of web and mobile experiences

Make a content­-first approach work

* Fuse responsive web design and mobile­-first with progressive enhancement
* Focus content, core tasks, and visual designs on a continuum

Establish a solid strategy for planning

* Sketch different experiences using basic UI elements and flow charts
* Plan decision points and outcomes from simple through complex interactions

Join us for this seminar if you:

* Need a manageable design process that works for your whole team
* Feel your sanity slipping away as more devices launch every. single. day.
* Want to plan, design, and test all potential experiences across platforms

If you’re trying to create a better web ­­ and are open to rethinking how you approach designing for any interface, then you need to watch Aaron’s seminar.
