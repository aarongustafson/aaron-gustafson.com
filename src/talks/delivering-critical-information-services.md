Early on, Internet access was considered a luxury. Those times have passed and the Internet, especially the Web, has become a necessity. Whether your users are trying to access their money, gather health information, attend class, apply for assistance, or any of the other hundreds (if not thousands) of critical tasks people do on the web, your site needs to be prepared to meet their needs. And it needs to work, no matter what.

In this session, Aaron discusses the many challenges to delivering critical information and services as well as the steps you can take to overcome those challenges. He’ll explore ways to make sure you can meet users on a variety of devices—and not the just the latest and greatest high end ones folks are talking about; how to make it accessible to people with disabilities; and how to load—and load quickly—on limited-bandwidth connections.
