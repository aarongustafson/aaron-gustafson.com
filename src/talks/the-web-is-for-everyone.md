As people who work on the Web, we are surrounded by technology-often very new, very fast, very shiny, very expensive technology. Immersed in this sea of ​​"latest and greatest" gadgets, it's easy to be lulled into believing that our experience is universal. It's not.

If headlines are to be believed, this is the era of the smartphone, the tablet, wearables, and what have you. But the reality is that there are millions of people who access the web. Accessing your bank balance, getting healthcare information, and booking iDevice.

Design is about solving problems. Yet, when we are tasked with addressing a universal need, we tend to be more easily reported. It's natural and completely understandable; it's easy empathy. It's a good place to start, but we need to push ourselves to learn about empathize with people who have different needs, experiences, and capabilities.

We should strive towards the equality of equal opportunity, while also accepting that it does not guarantee equal experience. And that's okay. Not everyone needs to have an identical experience, as long as they have a good experience.
