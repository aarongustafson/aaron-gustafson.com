For the last three years, our industry has been coming to terms with Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) and what they mean for the work we do every day. Scores of articles, reams of documentation, and dozens of white papers touting the successes and failures in this space can really get your head spinning. It’s easy to get lost in the complexities of service workers, manifests, and oh so many JavaScript frameworks and toolkits. Aaron believes it’s time to take a step back and refocus our attention on what really matters: building great web experiences. In this session, you’ll learn how to apply modern web design and development best practices to your web projects. You’ll learn how to grow a project from a core, universally-accessible experience to a sophisticated Progressive Web App that ensures users will be able to access your product, no matter what.
