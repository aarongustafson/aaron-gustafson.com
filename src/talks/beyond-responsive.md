Responsive web design has taken our industry by storm and with good reason: it helps us improve our reach with less effort. But incorporating responsive design is not the goal, meeting your user’s needs is. Responsive design is not an end in itself… it’s just the beginning.

Embracing the heterogenous nature of the web—the myriad web-enabled devices with vastly different dimensions, screen sizes, networks, and capabilities in use by countless individuals, each with their own special needs—allows you to craft experiences that will work anywhere at any time. It also helps you build robust systems that adapt in ways far beyond aesthetics. This talk will cover a number of considerations that you should be aware of, beyond screen size and pixel density, and provide examples of how to adapt your interfaces so they rise to meet your users’ needs.
