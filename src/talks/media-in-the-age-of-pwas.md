Our industry is abuzz with talk about Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) and with good reason: they are a great way to improve the experiences our users have on our sites, especially when it comes to performance. Using Service Workers—a key component of PWAs—we can manage network requests and the cache to an incredibly granular degree. We can also totally abuse the privilege Service Workers grant us when it comes to writing files to disk.

In this session, I discuss some of the potential pitfalls in implementing Service Workers, especially when it comes to managing heavy files like images and video. He’ll provide guidance on current best practices in cache management. And he’ll offer a few simple recipes you can put to use right away to deliver amazing experiences for your users that respect their data usage and disk space.
