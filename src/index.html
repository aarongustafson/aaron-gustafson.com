<h1>Hi there, I’m Aaron and I work on the&nbsp;web.</h1>

<p>Every day I strive to make the web more accessible, open,
and equitable place for people to live and work.</p>

<p>
Over the last {{ helpers.currentYear() - 1996 }} years, I’ve written
<a href="/publications/#books">{{ books_authored | length }} books</a> (contributing to 
{{ ( books_contributed | length ) + ( books_forewords | length ) + ( books_edited | length ) }}
more) and <a href="/publications/#articles">{{ articles | length }} articles</a> with that focus.

I’ve also presented on these and related topics at
<a href="/speaking-engagements/">over {{ speaking_engagements | length }} events</a> in
{{ ( cities | length ) - 1 }} cities across the globe.

<p>
I’m a Principal Program Manager on the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge">Microsoft 
Edge</a> team, where I oversee—among other things—our investments in Progressive Web Apps and developer UX.

I’m deeply involved in culture work within Microsoft, 
leading a team providing allyship training and do a lot of
internal consulting in and around inclusive design.

I’m also a spec editor at <a href="https://www.w3.org/">the W3C</a>, 
a former manager of the <a href="https://webstandards.org">Web Standards Project</a>,
Editor-in-chief of <a href="https://alistapart.com"><cite>A List Apart</cite></a>, 
and the founder of <a href="https://webwewant.fyi">the Web We Want</a>.
