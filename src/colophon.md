# Colophon

So you want to know more about what makes this site tick, huh? Well, itâ€™s powered by [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/), a Node-based static site generator created by [Zach Leatherman](https://twitter.com/zachleat). The site is hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

No frameworks were used in the creation of this site. I did use [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) to help me with my CSS workflow and use the [Susy](http://susy.oddbird.net/), [Breakup](https://github.com/BPScott/breakup), and [Quantity Query](https://github.com/danielguillan/quantity-queries) add-ins. I also use the [HTML5 Doctor CSS reset](http://html5doctor.com/html-5-reset-stylesheet/). I have a couple of [Gulp scripts](https://github.com/aarongustafson/aarongustafson.github.io/tree/source/tasks/gulp) I use to manage my builds.

Most of the icons used on the site are from [the Noun Project](https://thenounproject.com/).

The full source of this site is [available on Github]({{ site.repo_url }}).

Did I miss anything? If so, [ask and I will do my best to include it](/contact/).
