To say I was floored that the venerable <cite>Net Magazine</cite> asked if Iâ€™be be the subject of their Interview spread would be the understatement of the century. I mean holy crap! It was an honor to be asked and I loved getting to wax philosophical about progressive enhancement, web standards, and the future of web design.
