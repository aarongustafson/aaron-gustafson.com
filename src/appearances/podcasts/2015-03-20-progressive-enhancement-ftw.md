Jeffrey Zeldman and I discuss web design then and now; why Flipboard's 60fps web launch is anti-web and anti-user; Genesis's “Land of Confusion” video, and other bad ideas from the 1980s; design versus art; the demise and sendoff of Web Standards Sherpa; how the web community differs from other creative communities; and the 2nd Edition of my book, coming from New Riders this year.
