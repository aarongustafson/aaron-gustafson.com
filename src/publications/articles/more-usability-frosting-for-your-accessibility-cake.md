It goes without saying that the Mac IE implementation of `select`` boxes is the most usable way to display the information. You’re not forced to digest a long list of options at one time and can easily navigate your way through the choices.

Designers and developers looking for an easier way for users to digest this information have turned to JavaScript, but the problem is that scripts like these are not as accessible, don’t explicitly indicate the relationship between the groupings and their associated options and don’t work for users with JavaScript disabled.
