<h1 class="page__title">Notable Clients</h1>

<p>Over the last {{ helpers.currentYear() - 1996 }} years, I’ve had the pleasure of working with a bunch of amazing
organizations and brands. Often this work was done through my the agency I used to run, but some was also done in
partnership with other amazing companies and individuals. Below are a few of the highlights from this extensive list.</a>

<style>
  .listing__item__image {
    display: grid;
    place-items: center;
    width: 200px;
    height: 180px;
  }
  .listing__item__image svg {
    max-width: 80%;
    max-height: 80%;
    width: auto;
    height: auto;
  }
</style>

<ol class="listing listing--clients listing--grid">
  {% for client in clients %}
    <li class="listing__item listing__item--{{ forloop.index }} client">
      <div class="listing__item__image" aria-label="{{ client.name }}">
        {% set svg %}{{ ( "/src/static/i/c/" + client.logo ) | svgContents | safe }}{% endset %}
        {{ svg | safe }}
      </div>
    </li>
  {% endfor %}
</ol>
