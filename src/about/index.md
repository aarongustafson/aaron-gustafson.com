Hi there.
  
My name is Aaron Gustafson and I work on the web.

I am a web standards &amp; accessibility advocate at [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/), where I work closely with the Edge browser team. I also help organizations elegantly tackle the challenges presented by all the crazy devices and screens you see everywhere using [progressive enhancement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_enhancement) via [Easy Designs](http://easy-designs.net) and [Rosenfeld Media](http://rosenfeldmedia.com/experts/aaron-gustafson/). You’ll often find me on the road, [presenting at conferences and running workshops](http://noti.st/aarongustafson/) across the globe. 

I serve on the [<abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr>’s Responsive Issues Community Group](http://ricg.io/). I founded the [Chattanooga Open Device Lab](http://chadevicelab.org) and co-founded the event series [Code & Creativity](http://codeandcreativity.com) and [Retreats 4 Geeks](http://retreats4geeks.com). In previous roles, I managed the [Web Standards Project (WaSP)](http://webstandards.org) and published [Web Standards Sherpa](http://webstandardssherpa.com)

I wrote the web design book [Jeffrey Zeldman](http://zeldman.com) calls [a “modern classic”](https://alistapart.com/column/doctor-is-in) and [Jeremy Keith](http://adactio.com) calls [“the clearest, most beautiful explanation of progressive enhancement I’ve ever read”](https://adaptivewebdesign.info#adaptive-web-design-preview): [<cite>Adaptive Web Design</cite>](https://adaptivewebdesign.info). I’ve also contributed to [numerous other titles](/publications/#books). I have written [dozens of articles](/publications/#articles), and helped shape dozens more during my tenure as both a Tech Editor and Editor in Chief for the esteemed magazine [<cite>A List Apart</cite>](http://alistapart.com).

I live and work in beautiful Seattle, <abbr title="Washington">WA</abbr> with my lovely and talented partner [Kelly McCarthy](https://twitter.com/ShirleyTemper) and our amazing son Oscar.
