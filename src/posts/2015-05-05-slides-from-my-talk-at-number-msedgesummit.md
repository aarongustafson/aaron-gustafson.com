I just came off stage from my talk at the [Microsoft Edge Web Summit](https://web.archive.org/web/20150906080858/https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/WebPlatformSummit/2015) and I wanted to share [the deck](/notebook/slides-from-my-talk-at-number-msedgesummit/#figure-2015-05-05-01) with you. The talk was live-streamed, but I will post a video link as soon as it is up.

**Update:** [The video is now online](https://web.archive.org/web/20150613053312/http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/WebPlatformSummit/2015/Falling-in-love-with-forms). You can also [view it below](/notebook/slides-from-my-talk-at-number-msedgesummit/#figure-2015-05-05-02).
