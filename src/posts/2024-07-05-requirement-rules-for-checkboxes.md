HTML checkboxes debuted as [part of HTML 2.0 in 1995](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1866#section-8.1.2.3). Our ability to mark an individual checkbox as being required became part of the HTML5 spec that published in 2014. A decade later, we can still only make checkboxes required on a case-by-case basis. To overcome this limitation, I had created [a jQuery plugin that allowed me to indicate that a user should choose a specific number of items from within a checkbox group](https://github.com/easy-designs/easy-checkbox-required.js). Yesterday I turned that plugin into a web component: [`form-required-checkboxes`](https://github.com/aarongustafson/form-required-checkboxes).

## Markup Assumptions

Before I tuck into the details, I’ll start by saying that the web component begins with the assumption that you are following best practices with respect to form markup:

* Your checkbox group should be in a `fieldset` with a `legend`
* All of the checkbox elements must have the same `name` (e.g., "foo[]").

In other words, they should look something like this:

```html
<fieldset>
  <legend>Group 1 label</legend>
	<ul>
		<li><label>
      <input type="checkbox" name="foo[]" value="1">
      First item
    </label></li>
		<li><label>
		  <input type="checkbox" name="foo[]" value="2">
		  Second item
	  </label></li>
		<!-- options continue -->
	</ul>
</fieldset>
```

To use the web component, you wrap the group in a `form-required-checkboxes` element and then include the JavaScript to initialize it.

```html
<form-required-checkboxes>
  <fieldset>
    <legend>Group 1 label</legend>
	  <!-- etc. -->
  </fieldset>
</form-required-checkboxes>

<!-- at the end of your document -->
<script src="/js/web-components/form-required-checkboxes.js" async></script>
```

If you’re following right along, there’s an error waiting for you in the `console` — we need to set the requirement rules.

## The API

The `form-required-checkboxes` element requires at least one attribute to function, but using some of the others you can more fully customize the experience for users:

* `required` - Represents the range of required values. You can set this up in one of three ways depending on your needs:
  * Single number (e.g., 3) requires exactly that number of choices.
  * Range (e.g., 3-5) requires a minimum of the first number and a max of the second number be chosen.
  * Max (e.g., 0-3) requires a minimum of zero and a max of the second number to be chosen.
* `notice` (optional) - This is a string description that explains details of the required value in plan language. If you don’t supply one, the component will create one for you. This description will be added as a `small` element within the component (as a sibling to the `fieldset`).
* `error` (optional) - This is a string validation error you’d like to be shown when the validation criteria is not met. By default the component will use the notice text, but this gives you more flexibility.

## Demo

I put together a relatively simple demo of the web component over on GitHub:
