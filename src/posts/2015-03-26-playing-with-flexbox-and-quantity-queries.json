				"message": "<p>Aaron, great article. Thanks for sharing. I am building a similar grid as you for a portfolio. I want essentially the same thing as you have in that the items in the last row don't automattically fill the available space. I don't really need the special class items like you have for future events. However, I'd like the first child of the list to expand to 100 in a two column layout and the first-two children expand to 50% in a 3 col layout. I tried doing this and it breaks the layout. Any ideas?</p>",
