The fine folks at 18F just posted [a beautiful write-up of the talk on progressive enhancement that I delivered](https://18f.gsa.gov/2015/08/26/aaron-gustafson-beyond-responsive-design/) as part of the [18F Design Speaker Series](https://18f.gsa.gov/tags/speaker-series/). I thoroughly enjoyed talking to the folks that came. They presented some interesting challenges and asked pressing questions—exactly the kind of engagement I love.

They live-streamed the event and immediately [posted the video on YouTube](https://youtu.be/Fu1L34TLUHM). I also [posted the deck to SlideShare](http://www.slideshare.net/AaronGustafson/beyond-responsive-18f-2015) so you can follow along a little easier. I’ve embedded each below if you want to tuck in right away:
