Kelly, Oscar, and I are getting ready to head out for a long weekend up in Gatlinburg, TN to take a break from house selling insanity and kick off the celebration of our 16-year anniversary.

At scenic overlooks throughout Tennessee, the state has installed special viewfinders capable of bringing the gorgeous yellows, oranges, and reds of Fall to people who are colorblind. Those of us who aren’t colorblind, you may wonder what the big deal is, but for folks who’ve gone years, even decades without ever having seen what the big deal it, this can be transformative and humbling.

This is a wonderful reminder of the great opportunities we, as technologists, have for making a real difference, however small, in people’s lives. Look for those opportunities. Harness them. Make a difference in someone’s life.
