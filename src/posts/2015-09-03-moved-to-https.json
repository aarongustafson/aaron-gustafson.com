We'll see :-)</p><p>CloudFlare was certainly an option, but the problem there was one problem in that CloudFlare's connection to GitHub would not be over SSL unless I made it to the <a href=\"http://github.io\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" title=\"github.io\">github.io</a> address. There were some issues with that approach, based on my research. I don't recall the links offhand, but that's why I opted to go right into setting up my own SSL.</p>",
