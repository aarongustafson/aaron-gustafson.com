In watching [<cite>Atari: Game Over</cite>](http://www.slashfilm.com/watch-atari-game-over/), I couldn't help but see all of the parallels between the early video game industry and the web design industry. The boys’ club… Engineers as rockstars… It's a tale of a meteoric commercial rise followed by a swift and dismal collapse.

The film centers around the urban legend of millions of <cite>E.T. The Videogame</cite> cartridges being buried in a landfill in New Mexico as Atari burying it's shame over producing such a bad video game. Many cite <cite>E.T. The Videogame</cite> as the reason for the collapse of the industry in 1983, but it wasn't the case.

Xbox co-creator [Seamus Blackley](https://twitter.com/seamusblackley) offered this:

> The behavior patterns that created the conditions for the E.T. failure is what destroyed the video game industry.

The behavior patterns in question: greed; ridiculous timelines (E.T. was conceived and programmed in 5 weeks by one man: [Howard Scott Warshaw](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Scott_Warshaw)); and hubris.

There are a lot of parallels with the Silicon Valley of today. Food for thought.
