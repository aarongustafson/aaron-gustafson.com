				"message": "<p>Just the other day I saw something related to this.</p><p>I was perusing a marketing firm’s website and saw that they broke down their process into four main steps. Each step is represented by a simplistic illustration, a title, a short summary, and a generic “Read More” link below (which in itself could be improved, but I digress). Here’s the thing: the entire containing element reacts to the cursor hovering over it by slightly darkening the background, but only the Read More text is actually clickable.</p><p>Somebody actively set a <code>:hover</code> selector on the container element because they could. No other reason for it. They just could.</p>",
