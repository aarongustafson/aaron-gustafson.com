I just got this photo from [Tracey Croom](https://www.linkedin.com/pub/tracey-croom/13/a6/985), my production editor on [the Second Edition of <cite>Adaptive Web Design</cite>](http://adaptivewebdesign.info/2nd-edition/) and I wanted to share it with you. Production is almost done and I should be getting my bound copies soon. I’m so excited!
