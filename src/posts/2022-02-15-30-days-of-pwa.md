Today, [some colleagues and I](https://microsoft.github.io/win-student-devs/#/30DaysOfPWA/kickoff?id=brought-to-you-by) kicked off a new series on developing Progressive Web Apps. It will run for 30 days and takes you from the point of knowing nothing about PWAs all the way through integrating some of the amazing advanced capabilities available to web apps today.
