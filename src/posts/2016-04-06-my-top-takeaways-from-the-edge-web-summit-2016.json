It enables us to have a focused accessibility testing experience (yes, using only the speech from Narrator or the displayed text, which is like a position-aware subtitle) without annoying interruptions like having Narrator read the F12 tools when you go to debug an element or view the accessibility tree or switch over to read your email in Outlook.</p>",
