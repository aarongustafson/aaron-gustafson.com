				"message": "<p>\"Offline first\" means you code in a way that gives priority to local cached content, then use the network as an enhancement or a fallback. Sure, in the very first load, and for browsers without service worker support, you have to fall back to the network for everything, but your prioritisation is still offline-first, hence the name.</p><p>My reaction to your hatred of the term is pretty much \"get over it\", but do you have an alternative term in mind? \"Offline too\" makes the offline part sound like a secondary effort, it doesn't differentiate between offline vs online prioritisation, so it doesn't work.</p>",
