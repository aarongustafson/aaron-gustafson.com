				"message": "<p>While I agree with the premise of the article, I don't agree with the example of CSS variables / mixins / etc. It's likely to be very minimal overhead on first download and the browsers could store the processed version of the CSS in their cache the same way they do now -- you wouldn't be adding processing to every page load. If you're not passing proper cache headers on your CSS, then you've got bigger issues.</p>",

								"message": "<p>I'm not sure why variables would be dynamic -- CSS doesn't have logic constructs or a program loop. It would essentially just be moving the preprocessor to the browser instead of the development stack.</p><p>As far as calc(), yes, that's dynamic but would most likely IMPROVE user experience. All the current JavaScript implementations of calculating and resetting of widths would be replaced with a native implementation. It presents real value, not replacing something a developer can already do with a preprocessor.</p>",
