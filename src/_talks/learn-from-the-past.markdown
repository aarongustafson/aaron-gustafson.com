We are just starting to scratch the surface of what’s possible in voice-enabling the Web, but it’s exciting to see how some companies are addressing this opportunity. It’s always interesting when things come full circle and we see how lessons we learned early on in the Web remain applicable, not matter how much or quickly things seem to change. Seeing this pattern repeat time and time again is why I’m so drawn to the philosophy of progressive enhancement; it’s not only concerned with supporting the past… it’s setting us up for success in the future.
