Progressive Enhancement, the heart of Adaptive Design, makes the life of a design less complicated. Aaron and Jenn will show you how to create a solid core and build out to craft amazing user experiences that work regardless of devices capabilities or deficiencies.

Practical Takeaways from Aaron & Jenn’s Workshop:

* Integrate progressive enhancement with your process to take advantage of features and components as they surface.
* Prevent existing design decisions that unintentionally skew your analytics and narrow your outlook on web and mobile experiences.
* Fuse responsive web design and mobile­-first with progressive enhancement, and envision content, core tasks, and visual designs on a continuum.
