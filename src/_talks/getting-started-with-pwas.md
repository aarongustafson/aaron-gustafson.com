In this workshop, Aaron Gustafson will help you get your web projects super-charged as Progressive Web Apps (PWAs). The workshop will start off with an explanation of what PWAs are (and what they’re not), the use cases for and benefits of building them, and solid approaches to creating them. Then Aaron will walk you, step-by-step, through the process of turning a website into a PWA. Following along, you’ll author Web App Manifests and Service Workers and gain exposure to some next-gen APIs that tie them more deeply into the underlying operating system. By the end of the workshop, you’ll walk away with a functional PWA you can use right away.
