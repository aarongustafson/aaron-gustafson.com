“Progressive enhancement” is a philosophical approach to web design and development that centers users, with the goal of enabling everyone to access the content and complete core tasks, regardless of circumstances influencing how they access the web. In this session, I set the stage for why progressive enhancement is the gold standard for developing web projects before diving into a host of practical examples of how you can apply this practice to a range of interfaces. Along the way, I also show you how your entire team can (and should) get involved in the ideation, development, testing, and evolution of your interfaces and components.
