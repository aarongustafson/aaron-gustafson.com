Users are gradually becoming more accustomed to and reliant on voice-based interactions, so enabling users to complete critical tasks without a visual user interface is crucial for the long-term success of websites. This session shows how designing such a “headless” user interface is equivalent to designing the conversation you want to have with your users. Learn how to ensure that the technological decisions you make with respect to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript respect and support that conversation.
