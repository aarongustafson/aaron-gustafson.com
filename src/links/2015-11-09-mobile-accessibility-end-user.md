There’s a ton of great info in this article, but this one little bit is definitely worth calling out:

> Android app developers know that there are over 24,000 devices in the marketplace that can potentially run their app. The number of end users that can be reached is staggering and that sheer volume of individuals means that app developers tailor their build for the majority of users and not the minority. iOS developers don’t have the same level of device fragmentation but there are over 1.5 billion apps in the App Store and (again) millions of end users to think about.

Now consider that this is focused purely on platform-specific apps and not products delivered on the Web. We should do everything in our power to deliver _positive experiences_ to our users while simultaneously recognizing that it is impossible to deliver _the same experience_ to each of them.
