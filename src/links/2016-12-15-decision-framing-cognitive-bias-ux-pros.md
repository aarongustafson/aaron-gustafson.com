I love stuff like this!

<blockquote>
<p>Imagine you are working on a website design, and have just completed a usability test with 20 users. One task involved using the website’s search function, so you now have a numerical measurement of how many users were able to find and use the search function.</p>
<p>The task results could be stated in 2 different ways:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>4 out of 20 users could not find</strong> the search function on the website.</li>
  <li><strong>16 out of 20 users found</strong> the search function on the website.</li>
</ul>
<p>Logically, both of these statements describe exactly the same result, which is an objective data point. But if you’re like most people, the <em>conclusions </em>you come to might be very different depending on which phrasing is used.</p>

Biases affect our work; awareness helps us mitigate them, to a degree.
