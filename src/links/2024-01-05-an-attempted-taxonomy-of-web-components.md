I really appreciate Zach putting this together as it helped me sort through some ideas I had in my own head. It also kinda makes me want to update [a bunch of my old JavaScript components](https://github.com/orgs/easy-designs/repositories?q=&type=public&language=javascript&sort=) to remake them as lightweight HTML Web Components.
