An excellent read on how Andy Bell applied progressive enhancement to a project. I particularly liked this statement (emphasis his):

> Progressive enhancement isn’t necessarily _more work_ and it certainly isn’t a _non-JavaScript fallback_, it’s a change in how we think about our projects. A complete mindset change is required here and it starts by remembering that you don’t build websites for _yourself_, you build them for _others_.
