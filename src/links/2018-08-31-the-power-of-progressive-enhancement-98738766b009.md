An excellent read on how Andy Bell applied progressive enhancement to a project. I particularly liked this statement (emphasis his):

> Progressive enhancement isn’t necessarily *more work* and it certainly isn’t a *non-JavaScript fallback*, it’s a change in how we think about our projects. A complete mindset change is required here and it starts by remembering that you don’t build websites for *yourself*, you build them for *others*.
