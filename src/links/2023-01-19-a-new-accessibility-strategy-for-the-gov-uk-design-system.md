I love it when organizations share their strategy. In this case, it’s the UK government’s GDS sharing how they plan to approach accessibility, going forward.

<!-- more -->

Covered in this piece are:

1. Their approach to integrating WCAG 2.2
2. How they are changing their approach toward prioritization
3. Improvements they are making to accessibility testing
4. Their new approach to documentation

Gotta love their guiding principles too:

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The 4 principles of web accessibility help the team to create accessible components and experiences.</li>
<li>The 7 principles of universal design help the team when making design decisions.</li>
<li>Progressive enhancement helps the team develop styles, components, patterns and websites that are resilient and accessible across a variety of devices.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
