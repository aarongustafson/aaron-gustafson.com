Great minds think alike! Hereâ€™s Adrian Roselli on a means of adding link lists for printed pages (rather than offering expansions inline). Hard to believe [my piece on the topic ran in <cite>A List Apart</cite> over twelve years ago](https://alistapart.com/article/improvingprint)!

This is a fantastic, modern approach!
