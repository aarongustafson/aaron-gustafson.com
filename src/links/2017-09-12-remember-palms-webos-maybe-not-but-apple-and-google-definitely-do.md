WebOS… so far ahead of its time:

* Web code for apps (see PWAs),
* Multiple synchronized calendars,
* Unified social media & contact management,
* Curved displays
* Wireless charging
* Integrated text and Web messaging
* Unintrusive notifications
* "Cards" for running apps
* No home button (it used swipe instead)

And all of these features were available **eight years ago**!
