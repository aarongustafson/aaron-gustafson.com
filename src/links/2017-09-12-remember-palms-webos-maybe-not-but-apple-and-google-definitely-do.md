WebOS… so far ahead of its time:

- Web code for apps (see PWAs),
- Multiple synchronized calendars,
- Unified social media & contact management,
- Curved displays
- Wireless charging
- Integrated text and Web messaging
- Unintrusive notifications
- "Cards" for running apps
- No home button (it used swipe instead)

And all of these features were available **eight years ago**!
