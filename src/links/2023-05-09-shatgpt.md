This is an excellent post from Steve Faulkner on some of the issues with Large Language Models like ChatGPT, especially when it comes to accessibility. He clearly outlines three key areas where we are failing:

1. The base UI is inaccessible (or barely accessible).
2. Features are hidden from people using Assistive Technologies.
3. Advice they give on making interfaces more accessible do more harm than good.
