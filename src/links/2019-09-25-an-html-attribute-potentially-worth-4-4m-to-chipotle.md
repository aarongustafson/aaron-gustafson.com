Excellent forensic investigation from Jason. Reminds me of the kind of stuff we used to do over on [Web Standards Sherpa](https://webstandardssherpa.com/). You should absolutely read the whole thing, but I’ll give you the key takeaways here as your site may be making the same mistake as Chipotle.

> There are three key takeaways from Chipotle’s order form that you should consider:
> 
> 1. Use HTML5 input features
> 2. Support autofill
> 3. Make autofill part of your test plans
