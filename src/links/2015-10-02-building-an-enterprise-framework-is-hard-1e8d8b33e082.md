My good friend [Stef Sullivan Rewis](https://www.w3conversions.com/index.cfm) shared a bit about the process and decision-making that went into the CSS Framework underpinning [Salesforce’s Lightning Design System](https://www.lightningdesignsystem.com/). It’s a worthwhile read and will definitely be helpful if you’re undertaking a similar project.
