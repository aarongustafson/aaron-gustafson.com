The folks at Canva have amassed a pretty expansive color tool that discusses various aspects—like history and associations—of a ridiculous number of colors. This resource also helps you build color sets around each of the colors by exploring complementary colors, analogous colors, and color triads that include it. Pretty cool stuff!
