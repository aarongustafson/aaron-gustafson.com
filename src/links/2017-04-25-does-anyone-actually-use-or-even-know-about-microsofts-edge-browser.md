Edge usage is growing. NetMarketShare.com puts it above Safari usage on macOS and the U.S. government websites have seen more than 98 million visits in the last 3 months alone. If youâ€™re not testing on Edge you should be.

- PS - You can [test on Edge for free over on Browserstack](https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2017/03/30/free-edge-testing-browserstack/).
