Another deep dive into `details` and `summary`, courtesy of Scott. He’s tested so many permutations and edge cases that this is really required reading if you’re considering using this element pairing for progressive disclosure.

> `<details>` and `<summary>` elements are complicated. Saying don’t use them isn’t really practical and there’s a lot of good things about them. But they do have bugs. … It really just all comes down to what sort of experience you want to provide to people, and how OK you might be knowing that the native elements are going to be exposed differently, have different gaps but also different features to them.
