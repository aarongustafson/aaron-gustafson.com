Accessibility is an afterthought in much of our industry. In order to change that, education needs to change and code schools need to change. Karl nails it in this post:

> While Hacker You should be applauded for their regular lunch-and-learns, I think that all computer schools should include accessibility embedded in core curriculum. It will create an alumni population better prepared to create interfaces that are universally usable. Their alumni will be differentiated by their ability to consider the user’s needs. After all, if you’re not developing for the user, who are you developing for?
