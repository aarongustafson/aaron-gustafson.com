An interesting look at color blindness from [Aaron Tenbuuren](https://www.aarontenbuuren.com/), a designer living with it. He offers some great examples of good design for color blind users from Trello, Google, and more.

> [W]hen designing apps, we should not look at individual colors and ask if they are ‘visible’, but rather look at groupings of colors, and see if they are distinguishable. Even then, we may require more visual aids to make sure that users will not mistake one color for another.
