A recent paper from Forrester (commissioned by Microsoft, my employer), has confirmed my anedotal experiences are not outliers:

> This new study, based on a 2025 online survey of 3,901 US consumers, confirms what many of us know: accessible technology empowers everyone. And with the rise of AI, we’re entering a new era of possibility. 

One of the stats that’s likely to be surprising to many people is that people who identify as having disabilities and those who don’t both use assistive technology features at nearly the same rate.
