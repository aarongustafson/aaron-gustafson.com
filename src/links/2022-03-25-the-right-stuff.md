Would people who are disabled here on Earth make excellent astronauts? Dr. Sheri Wells-Jensen thinks they could. This episode of [Radiolab](https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/radiolab/) takes zero-gravity flight with a host of people with disabilities to explore that question.

This podcast brought me so much joy in experiencing the participants’ profound joy in both weightlessness and freedom. It also brought me so much sadness with respect to how far we’ve yet to come with our treatment of people with disabilities here on Earth. In the end though, it left me with hope though. Lots of hope.
