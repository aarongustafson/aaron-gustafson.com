Love this analogy from Stuart: Front-end frameworks are essentially compilers that you require your users to run on their own machines to access your project!

> Old joke: someone walks into a cheap-looking hotel and asks for a room. You’ll have to make your own bed, says the receptionist. The visitor agrees, and is told: you’ll find a hammer and nails behind the door.
