Apps in the [Windows Store](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/apps) can now be flagged as accessible on submission. Not sure if anyone is validating these claims, but my guess is that they will if it becomes abused. Regardless, I’m excited to see Microsoft take this step to make it easier for folks who need it to find accessible apps.
