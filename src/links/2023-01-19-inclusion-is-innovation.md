Having worked in the D&I space within Microsoft for a few years now, it’s great to see the things we’ve been discussing internally making it out into the world.

It all goes hand-in-hand:

1. Screen in for diverse perspectives during the interview process.
2. Foster inclusive teams that value and promote people for not only their productive capacity, but also their unique experiences & perspectives.
3. Empower everyone to influence product/service design.
4. Release products that serve everyone because those products were created by people who share lived experiences with everyone.
