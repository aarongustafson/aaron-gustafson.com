In this episode, Trevor Noah and Brad Smith talk about a lot of things, but I think the most prescient is their discussion of information bubbles and organizing around labels. Trevor astutely observes how the source of information often colors how we receive that information and whether we consider it or reject it out of hand. In today’s media ecosystem, the system of “in groups” and “out groups” creates deep division and makes us more susceptible to misinformation.
