A good walkthrough on how to build a form that hooks into an API and works either with or without JavaScript.

One note however: Austin in incorrect in that you absolutely can define nested objects in your forms. Iâ€™ve done it many times. Your field names just need to use bracket notation like this:

```
<input name="foo['bar']['baz']">
```

That will pipe through as the value for the <var>baz</baz> property of <var>bar</var> within <var>foo</var>.
