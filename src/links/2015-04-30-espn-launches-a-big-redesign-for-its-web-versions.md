ESPN launched its responsive site. I still need to tuck into it, but here’s a little background as to why:

> In January, 61 percent of ESPN’s roughly 94 million users in the United States were viewing content exclusively on mobile devices, with a good chunk of that viewing content on its mobile web version. For a massive company like Disney trying to make a shift to mobile like any other content-driven company, a test of a new mobile web strategy for a large property like ESPN is critical.
