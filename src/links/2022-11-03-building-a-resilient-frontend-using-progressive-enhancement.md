How did I miss this? The gov.uk Service Manual recommends progressive enhancement for all their websites.

> Using progressive enhancement means your users will be able to do what they need to do if any part of the stack fails. Building your service using progressive enhancement will:
>
> - make your service more resilient
> - mean your service’s most basic functionality will work and meet the core needs of the user
> - improve accessibility by encouraging best practices like writing semantic markup
> - help users with device or connectivity limitations to use your service
