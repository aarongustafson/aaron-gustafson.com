Cool to see more efficient range-based media queries are beginning to roll out.

> The big change in the Media Queries Level 4 specification is that we have new operators that compare values rather than combining them:
>
> - < evaluates if a value is less than another value
> - &gt; evaluates if a value is greater than another value
> - = evaluates if a value is equal to another value
> - <= evaluates if a value is less than or equal to another value
> - &gt;= evaluates if a value is greater than or equal to another value

🤞🏻 we get them in Safari soon!
