Subtitles are yet another example of an accessibility feature that improves the experience of a much broader audience.

Personally, I started using closed captions when we came home with Oscar. It also me to watch movie & shows while he slept in my arms. Interestingly, Iâ€™ve always tuned in dialogue subtitles in video games.
