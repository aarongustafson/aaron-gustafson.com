This is a very exciting announcement!

> Both the Microsoft Edge and PWABuilder teams are extremely excited to share this Preview of new Edge PWAs in the Microsoft Store with developers today. We are eager to see developers leverage the full capabilities of the new Edge in their PWAs and ship awesome experiences to the Microsoft Store!

<!-- more -->

With this launch, PWAs delivered by the Microsoft Store now have full access to new (and future) web platform APIs without having to invoke UWP code—as was necessary under the previous Store PWA incarnation—including:

* [Shortcuts](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/Manifest/shortcuts),
* [Protocol handling](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/MSEdgeExplainers/blob/main/URLProtocolHandler/explainer.md),
* [URI handling](https://github.com/WICG/pwa-url-handler/blob/master/explainer.md),
* [File Type Associations](https://github.com/WICG/file-handling/blob/master/explainer.md),
* [Share Target](https://wicg.github.io/web-share-target/),
* [Web Bluetooth](https://webbluetoothcg.github.io/web-bluetooth/),
* [Web Share](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Navigator/share),
* [File System Access API](https://wicg.github.io/file-system-access/), and
* [App Badging](https://wicg.github.io/badging/).

It’s been very cool to see the evolution of support for PWAs from within Microsoft and I can’t wait for y’all to see what’s coming in the not to distant future :-)
