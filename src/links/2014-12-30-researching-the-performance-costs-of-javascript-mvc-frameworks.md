I often talk about the negative performance impact of using front-end MVC frameworks like Angular and Ember to generate your HTML. It should be pretty obvious why: a framework must be downloaded, interpreted, and executed before any HTML is generated and eventually rendered in the browser. The one thing I had yet to do was actually see how the various frameworks stack up side-by-side. Now the [Filament Group](https://www.filamentgroup.com) has done just that.

If you are using or are considering a front-end Javascript framework, you need to read this report.
