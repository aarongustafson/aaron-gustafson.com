Another fantastic resource from Adrian Roselli. This is a collection of diagnostic tools that

* Restore Link Underlines,
* Restore Focus Outlines,
* Find Inline Styles,
* Find Duplicate ARIA Roles, and
* Find Missing Alt Attributes.

If this sounds cool, you may also like his [Accessibility Bookmarklets and Tools](http://blog.adrianroselli.com/2012/06/accessibility-bookmarklets-and-tools.html).
