I feel this piece deep in my bones. If you are a PM, designer, or developer building stuff for the web, you owe it to yourself to give it a read.

I could quote the ever-living crap out of it, but I’ll just drop this one choice excerpt and let you take the rest in, in context:


> [W]e’re not asking you to abandon your favorite frontend library on a whim and become a Rails developer, or a Phoenix developer, or a whatever. We’re simply asking you to acknowledge that for years you’ve completely hogged and dominated the #WebDev conversation, ignored our repeated attempts to point out the potential flaws, foot guns, and fallacies with the JS/SPA approach, and in some cases even ridiculed us for our choice of technology stack/language/etc.
