If you follow web components, you’ve no doubt heard of [Polymer](https://polymer-project.org/). It’s the most popular library, but the 2nd most popular is X-Tag. The project was founded at Mozilla and is backed by Microsoft too. It’s standards-based, lightweight, has a generous support matrix, and plays well with other libraries. If you’re into web components, you should check it out.
