Excellent advice here:

> [N]ext time you’re designing a new interface paradigm or chatting with an engineer, ask yourself about the risks involved in the known versus the unknown with the following questions.
>
> * Does the new design use intuitive patterns that prioritize consistency?
> * Are you in any way disregarding accessibility practices in favor of a feature or a visual direction?
> * How tech-savvy are your users and can the newly-introduced experience be easily adopted by current and future, more-diverse audiences?
> * Can and will your design decisions be validated through properly conducted user research and user testing?
>
> Being mindful of these practices will help you guide decisions and ensure you don’t change things just because you can.
