I have mixed emotions about this move to repurpose the utterly terrifying Boston Dynamics robots as service robots, but there are some upsides too.

- Pro: No waste to clean up & dispose of
- Pro: Can be used by people with allergies
- Pro: Has no mouth, will never bite
- Pro: People are less likely to try to pet/distract your service robot
- Pro: Can likely be trained (or sensor-enabled) to recognize more objects and scenarios than a dog can (or at least the specific breeds we employ as service animals)
- Pro: Would be of service for someone’s lifetime (and beyond) if maintained properly
- Pro: Knowledge & personality (if there is one) can be migrated to a new robot if the current one breaks
- Questionable: Potentially less costly to own, assuming power & maintenance is less than the [US$1000-2000/yr it costs to own the average dog](https://yourdogadvisor.com/dog-annual-cost/)
- Con: Far more expensive upfront
- Con: Unlikely to be a companion in nearly the same way (though [robots with personality](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/keyitechnology/meet-loona-the-petbot-you-will-fall-in-love) is something folks are working on)
- Con: Not warm or furry
