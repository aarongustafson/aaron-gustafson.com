I have mixed emotions about this move to repurpose the utterly terrifying Boston Dynamics robots as service robots, but there are some upsides too.

* Pro: No waste to clean up & dispose of
* Pro: Can be used by people with allergies
* Pro: Has no mouth, will never bite
* Pro: People are less likely to try to pet/distract your service robot
* Pro: Can likely be trained (or sensor-enabled) to recognize more objects and scenarios than a dog can (or at least the specific breeds we employ as service animals)
* Pro: Would be of service for someone’s lifetime (and beyond) if maintained properly
* Pro: Knowledge & personality (if there is one) can be migrated to a new robot if the current one breaks
* Questionable: Potentially less costly to own, assuming power & maintenance is less than the [US$1000-2000/yr it costs to own the average dog](https://yourdogadvisor.com/dog-annual-cost/)
* Con: Far more expensive upfront
* Con: Unlikely to be a companion in nearly the same way (though [robots with personality](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/keyitechnology/meet-loona-the-petbot-you-will-fall-in-love) is something folks are working on)
* Con: Not warm or furry
