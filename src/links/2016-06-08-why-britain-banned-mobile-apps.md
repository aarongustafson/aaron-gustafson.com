This! An excellent interview with Ben Terrett:

> Apps are “very expensive to produce, and they’re very very expensive to maintain because you have to keep updating them when there are software changes”

But…

> Sites can adapt to any screen size, work on all devices, and are open to everyone to use regardless of their device. “If you believe in the open internet that will always win,” he says. And they’re much cheaper to maintain, he adds, because when an upgrade is required, only one platform needs recoding.
