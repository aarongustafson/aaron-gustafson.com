Lots of real-world feedback about accessibility issues here. The laundry list of pain points is not insurmountable though:

- Missing captions
- Motion & animations
- Visual clutter
- Walls of text
- Small text
- Sites that don’t play well with magnifiers
- Low contrast
- Text in images
- Bright colors
- Reliance on color to convey information
- Mouse-centric interactions
- Tiny touch targets
- CAPTCHAs

You can address most of these easily.
