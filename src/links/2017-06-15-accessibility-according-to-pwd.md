Lots of real-world feedback about accessibility issues here. The laundry list of pain points is not insurmountable though:

* Missing captions
* Motion & animations
* Visual clutter
* Walls of text
* Small text
* Sites that donâ€™t play well with magnifiers
* Low contrast
* Text in images
* Bright colors
* Reliance on color to convey information
* Mouse-centric interactions
* Tiny touch targets
* CAPTCHAs

You can address most of these easily.
