Amidst all the kerfuffle over Appleâ€™s push to drop PWAs (a.k.a., Home Screen Apps), two PWA features I worked on quietly landed in Safari for desktop: shortcuts & categories.

> * Added support for the `shortcuts` manifest member on macOS. Shortcuts are available in the File menu and the Dock context menu. Users can set up custom keyboard shortcuts for them in System Settings > Keyboard > Keyboard Shortcuts > App Shortcuts. (106137954)
> 
> * Added support for the `categories` manifest member on macOS. When creating a Launchpad folder containing web apps, the folder is automatically named accordingly. (116480550)
