1. We’ve lost control of our personal data
2. It’s too easy for misinformation to spread on the web
3. Political advertising online needs transparency and understanding

> These are complex problems, and the solutions will not be simple. But a few broad paths to progress are already clear. We must work together with web companies to strike a balance that puts a fair level of data control back in the hands of people

I hope it happens.
