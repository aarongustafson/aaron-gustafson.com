This is a pretty interesting idea and I see where [Peter Bright](https://twitter.com/drpizza) is coming from with this sentiment:

> Although Microsoft has endeavored to be more open about how it's developing its browser, and which features it is prioritizing, that development nonetheless takes place in private. Developing in the open, with a public bug tracker, source code repositories, and public discussion of the browser's future direction is the next logical step.

With Microsoft [opening up their process](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/platform/status/?q=) [more and more](https://wpdev.uservoice.com/forums/257854-internet-explorer-platform/), I wonder if they’ve considered open-sourcing Trident (or whatever is driving [“Project Spartan”](http://www.theverge.com/2015/1/21/7863331/microsoft-project-spartan-new-web-browser) under the hood).
