This is about tech for social good, which is awesome, but one of the most interesting bits is buried near the bottom and concerns us as web designers:

> According to the Office for National Statistics, in May, 27% of disabled adults had [never used the internet](https://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/publications/re-reference-tables.html?edition=tcm%3A77-395602), compared with 7% of non-disabled adults. And last month’s report by the Extra Costs Commission found that part of the reason disabled people typically face £550 in extra living costs is due to the lack of ability of many of them to shop around online. Too many sites are not accessible to those with disabilities.
