A tale of woe as old as… well, the Web. The Web is mutable. Content disappears, for good and for bad. This is part of the reason projects like [Archive.org](https://archive.org/web/) and [Perma.cc](https://perma.cc/) excite me so much. It’s also why [I chose to use Perma.cc to archive every site referenced in my book](https://aarongustafson.github.io/notebook/avoiding-linkrot-in-print-with-the-help-of-perma-dot-cc/).
