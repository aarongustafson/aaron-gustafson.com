This is a foundational paper concerning AI and its potential to help and harm people with disabilities. There are a lot of choice quotes in here, but this one really sums up the importance of an intersectional approach to AI:

> Integrating disability into the AI bias conversation helps illuminate the tension between AI systems’ reliance on data as the primary means of representing the world, and the fluidity of identity and lived experience. Especially given that the boundaries of disability (not unlike those of race and gender) have continually shifted in relation to unstable and culturally specific notions of “ability,” something that has been constructed and reconstructed in relationship to the needs of industrial capitalism, and the shifting nature of work.
