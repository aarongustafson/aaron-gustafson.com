I don’t know that *advocacy* is the issue. Perhaps a better title would be “Developers should keep an open mind” or ”The most important thing to know is you don’t know everything”.

This is a great post and Colin makes a lot of the same arguments I make in Chapter 5 of *Adaptive Web Design, Second Edition*. Great minds!
