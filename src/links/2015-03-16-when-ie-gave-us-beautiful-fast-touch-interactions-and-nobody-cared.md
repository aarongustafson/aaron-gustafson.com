I never even saw this proposal, but how cool would it be to set snap points for scrolling content in  CSS?!

```css
.container {
  width: 500px;
  overflow-x: auto;
  overflow-y: hidden;
  white-space: nowrap;
  /* Set up points to which scrolling will snap */
  -ms-scroll-snap-points-x: snapInterval(0px, 100%);
  /* Require that scrolling always end at a snap point */ 
  -ms-scroll-snap-type: mandatory; 
}
```
