I love this piece from Tomas Pustelnik. It walks through all the work you need to do to build a fake button using a `div` when you could have just used a `button`.

It’s kinda the inverse of a piece I wrote for <cite>Smashing</cite> a few years back: [Developing Dependency Awareness](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/05/developing-dependency-awareness/).
