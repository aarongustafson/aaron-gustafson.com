Heck, a couple of us were there for the first couple of attempts too. Do you remember Jaxer? JsExt? Rhino?"

When we old timers bemoan developersâ€™ overreliance on JavaScript, we are coming at it from the perspective of folks who were building for the web *before* JavaScript was a server-side thing.

Some of us remember the early attempts at bringing JS to the server too. Remember Jaxer? JsExt? Rhino? Fun times.
