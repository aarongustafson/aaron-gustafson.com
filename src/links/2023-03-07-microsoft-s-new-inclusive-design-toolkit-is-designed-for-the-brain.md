The [Microsoft Inclusive Design Toolkit](https://inclusive.microsoft.design/) has gotten an update that [incorporates cognition](https://inclusive.microsoft.design/tools-and-activities/InclusiveDesignForCognitionGuidebook.pdf), which is awesome! It puts forward three new principles:

> 1. Understand the user’s motivation, and the goals and tasks they are trying to complete.
> 2. Discern the cognitive load required to reduce that mismatch.
> 3. Co-create the final product with a diverse community of people across the spectrum.

It’s so great to see this seminal resource continuing to evolve.
