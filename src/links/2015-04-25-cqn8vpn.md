A snarky, clever backhanded rant against the JavaScript-only crowd. Good for a chuckle:

> They aren't really on your site to read your article or check what time their train leaves - they're really there to marvel at your buttery-smooth, hardware-accelerated 60fps animations and 1337 client-side javascript skillz that mean you can browse the entire site without ever once touching the server after the first page-load... just as long as you don't mind that first page-load being 3MB in size, crapping out on unreliable mobile connections and taking whole seconds between DOM-ready and the UI actually appearing.
