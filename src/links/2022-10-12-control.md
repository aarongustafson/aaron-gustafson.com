Early on in my journey as a web designer, [Molly Holzschlag](https://twitter.com/mholzschlag) taught me the importance of controlling everything you can, up until the point that you realize you must relinquish control. In this piece, Jeremy Keith explores the tension around control and, ultimately, echoes Molly’s perspective:

> The web is filled with uncertainties—browsers, devices, networks. You can’t possibly account for all of the possible variations. On the web, you have to relinquish some control.
