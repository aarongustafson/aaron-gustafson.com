I agree with so much of this pieceâ€¦ especially [the expansive view of accessibility that is inclusive of both the disability divide and the digital divide](https://www.aaron-gustafson.com/speaking-engagements/delivering-critical-information-services/).

Great summary here:

> [M]y passion for accessibility stems from experiencing accessibility barriers personally, observing their impact on others, and holding the conviction that technology should tear down divides - not erect new ones. I want to fulfill, and help you fulfill, the web's promise of equal access and opportunity for everyone, regardless of circumstances. Digital accessibility should not be an accommodation but a fundamental right and prerequisite for technology to truly better humanity.
