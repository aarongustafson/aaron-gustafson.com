I wonder how many app developers will needlessly flip this switch and cut off every iOS device that doesn’t have a 64 bit processor. Given that with every new phone release, sales of the old ones spike, the folks that buy the older models may be a little miffed to find out the apps they want to use have decided it’s inconvenient to support them.
