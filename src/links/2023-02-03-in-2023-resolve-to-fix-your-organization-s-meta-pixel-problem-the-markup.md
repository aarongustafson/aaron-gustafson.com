It’s hard to believe it’s 11 years after [I wrote about dropping 3rd party share links & such to protect your users’ privacy](https://blog.easy-designs.net/archives/dont-sell-out-your-users/) and we’re still having to have this conversation. You need to get rid of the Facebook/Meta pixel. And if you can’t do it everywhere, at least do remove it from pages with sensitive content. Don’t sell out your users!
