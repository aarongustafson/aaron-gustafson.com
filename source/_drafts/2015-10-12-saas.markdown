* used to be simple: standard corporate browser
* tailor sites to a browser’s quirks
* The web evolved, the sites didn’t
* that was a big part of why Microsoft introduced version targeting
* ActiveX and BHOs
* Edge falls back to IE11
* mobile happened - few companies have corporate standard mobile devices anymore (they used to—blackberry)
* BYOD and VPNs, working from home
* No longer have control over the execution environment
* No longer have control over the network
* It’s time for intranets and legacy applications to get updated to web standards or get the boot.
* It will take time, but the investment in reaching more devices is well worth it. And it doesn’t have to be expensive
* Progressive enhancement.
