Forms exist on pretty much every site on the web in one form or another. They are the primary mechanism by which we gather information from our users.[^1] Of course, before anyone can fill out a form, they need to know what it’s asking for. Labeling is key.

A few months back, I relayed [a story from Facebook](https://www.aaron-gustafson.com/notebook/consider-how-your-forms-read/) about how important the wording of their questions was in getting accurate responses from their users. The words we use are incredibly important. After all, your interface is a conversation with your users. I highly recommend reading that post (and [listening to the Radiolab episode](http://www.radiolab.org/story/trust-engineers/) I was reacting to), but I’m going to spend the remainder of this post talking about the utilitarian aspects of labels and how to use them properly in your forms.

## Connecting the Dots

When you look at a basic form field, you have two bits of information: the field and the label.
