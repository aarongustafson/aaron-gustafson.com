It’s hard to believe, but I’ve presented over 
{% for event in site.data.events %}
	{% if forloop.index == 1 %}
		{{ forloop.length }}
	{% endif %}
{% endfor %}
conferences and workshops since 2003. And that’s just the public stuff. I’ve also presented numerous talks and customized workshops for a bunch of companies. I wish I could tell you who they were, but let’s just say you’ve likely patronized most of them and have definitely heard of the others.

You can keep up with my travels on Lanyrd and if you want me to come present at your company or conference, [drop me a line](/contact).
