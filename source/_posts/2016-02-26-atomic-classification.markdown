We’ve run into similar issues with Pattern Lab’s enforced groupings on a large client project. Some just didn’t make sense, causing a little confusion for our team, but way more confusion for the client’s team. It added way more cognitive overhead than was really necessary for the project. The tool made testing components easy, but we eventually ended up leaving some buckets empty.
