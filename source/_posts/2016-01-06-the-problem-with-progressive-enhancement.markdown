Alex Lande doesn’t believe optimizing for a no-JavaScript scenario makes sense, but he does believe in building a robust web experience pays huge dividends.

> Progressive enhancement is a tool that will help you build faster, tougher sites. It is an investment in the strength and quality of your application. It will make your users happy because the app will still work, if imperfectly. It might just save you when disaster strikes, and if you’re interested in building the best websites possible, you should give it some thought.

Eloquently put.
