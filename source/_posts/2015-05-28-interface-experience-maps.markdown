One of the greatest challenges of progressive enhancement lies not with the coding, but with the planning. It can be incredibly challenging to articulate how a single interface might adapt to a wide variety of situations.

Back in 2007, I was presented with this challenge while putting together a talk called [Ruining the User Experience](https://web.archive.org/web/20070515221318/http://2007.sxsw.com/interactive/programming/panels/?action=show&id=IAP060214) (which I co-presented for the first time with at SXSW with [Sarah B. Nelson](https://twitter.com/sarahbeee)). In the talk, Sarah and I were discussing how to treat JavaScript as an enhancement and what happens when you don’t—in 2007, I know!

Anyway, in the talk I was trying to convey the various decision points and interface adjustments that would happen as a result of those decisions. I don’t remember which of us came up with the idea—it was probably Sarah—but we opted to use flowcharts to visually describe what we were talking about on stage. Here was the first one we did:

<figure id="fig-2015-05-28-01" class="media-container">{% adaptive_image /i/posts/2015-05-28/01.png %}<figcaption>An early flowchart used to describe progressive enhancement with JavaScript</figcaption></figure>

It was pretty rudimentary, but it got the point across.
