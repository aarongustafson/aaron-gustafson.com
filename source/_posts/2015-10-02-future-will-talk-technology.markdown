Depending on how you read the title, your expectations for this article may not align with the subject: the technical means by which we talk to our devices. It’s not about the APIs or voice recognition, but rather how our desires are transferred from our mind to our device’s "ears". Voice is obviously one way—and David spends a lot of time discussing microphone improvements—but it could also be silently using subvocalization.

If—like me—this stuff fascinates you, you should definitely give it a read.
