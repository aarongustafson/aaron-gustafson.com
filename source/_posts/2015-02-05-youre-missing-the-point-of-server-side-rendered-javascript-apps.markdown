I agree with Tom Dale. Yup, you read that right: I agree with Tom Dale. Well, he finally said something sensible:

> Say what you will about server-rendered apps, the performance of your server is much more predictable, and more easily upgraded, than the many, many different device configurations of your users. Server-rendering is important to ensure that users who are not on the latest-and-greatest can see your content immediately when they click a link.

You might remember Tom as the guy who [declared progressive enhancement dead in late 2013](http://tomdale.net/2013/09/progressive-enhancement-is-dead/). He’s apparently seen the light and has been hard at work to get Ember ready for server side rendering.

I’m shocked, but glad he finally came around. Progressive enhancement FTW!
