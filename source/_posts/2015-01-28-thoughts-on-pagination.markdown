Pagination is pretty arbitrary. Could it be better? Probably.

> For example, take your average photo site that displays the content in a reverse chronological order: that is, newest to oldest. Let's say your friend has posted 2000 photos to this site. The site shows the viewer 10 things per page. With our prolific user, this gives us 200 pages.

> Going to the middle of this content takes us to page 100. What does this mean, beyond we're at the middle? Not much.
