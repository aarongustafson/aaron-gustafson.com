Riffing on [a post in ReCode](http://www.recode.net/2016/6/8/11883518/app-boom-over-snapchat-uber) and [research done by Quartz](http://qz.com/253618/most-smartphone-users-download-zero-apps-per-month/), Slashdot asked its readership if apps are done. The comments are especially telling. My personal favorite is this gem:

> Everything has an "app" â€¦ that is a sad rehash of their website. I don't need access to a diluted version of your content SO BAD that I'm going to store an icon for it on my phone. Maybe if people started releasing apps that were AT LEAST as fully functional as their webpages (hopefully more) people would actually download them.

Long live the Web!
