A brief but inspiring profile of [Greg Smith](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/people/gregsmi/), a quadriplegic programmer and principal software engineer in Microsoft Research.

This bit was pretty incredible:

> He puts together the skeleton of whatever section of code he’s working on that day in his mind. Then, using a camera that responds to his head movements and a mouth-controlled mouse and a metal clicker that he's been using for 20 years, he's able to key in the code—letter by letter.
> It would take too long to type out the code first and then start rearranging. So that part he does by memory.
