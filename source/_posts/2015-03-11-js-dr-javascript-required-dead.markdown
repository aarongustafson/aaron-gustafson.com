It’s a tough pill to swallow, but it’s true:

> Pages that are empty without JS: dead to history (archive-org), unreliable for search results (despite any search engine claims of JS support, check it yourself), and thus ignorable. No need to waste time reading or responding.

> …

> Because in 10 years nothing you built today that depends on JS for the content will be available, visible, or archived anywhere on the web.

> All your fancy front-end-JS-required frameworks are dead to history, a mere evolutionary blip in web app development practices. Perhaps they provided interesting ephemeral prototypes, nothing more.
