Adrian has put together a great overview of why `lang` is important and how many sites are using it. Here are a few takeaways:

<blockquote>
	<ol>
		<li>VoiceOver on iOS uses the attribute to auto-switch voices.</li>
		<li>VoiceOver can speak a particular language using a different accent when specified.</li>
		<li>Leaving out the `lang` attribute may require the user to manually switch to the correct language for proper pronunciation.</li>
		<li>JAWS uses it to load the correct phonetic engine/phonologic dictionary — Handy for sites with multiple languages.</li>
		<li>NVDA (Windows) uses it in the same way as VoiceOver and JAWS.</li>
		<li>When used in HTML that is used to form an ePub or Apple iBooks document, it affects how VoiceOver will read the book.</li>
		<li>Firefox, IE10, and Safari (as of a year ago) only support CSS `hyphens: auto` when the `lang` attribute is set.</li>
	</ol>
</blockquote>

Thanks for putting this together Adrian!
