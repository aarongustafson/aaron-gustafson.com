This is a beautiful piece from Microsoft’s General Counsel on the importance of considering special needs within the umbrella of diversity. I particularly loved this bit:

> At its core the ADA is not about the dimensions of doorways, but the individuals who can now pass through them.

> A vision for the ADA that focuses on people helps enfranchise so many who have been excluded for so long. It also enriches and opens our institutions to the very best and brightest talent our country has to offer. That is the power of diversity and why diversity efforts should include disability.
