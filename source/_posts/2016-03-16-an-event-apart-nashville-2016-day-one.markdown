Unfortunately, I was unable to spend Tuesday in Nashville for An Event Apart (for reasons that will be revealed in about a month), but I did catch Monday and it was amazing.

The esteemed [Jeffrey Zeldman](http://www.zeldman.com/) kicked the day off with a talk entitled *Designing with Web Standards in 2016*. A theme he touched on repeatedly was that none of the problems we are facing in web design today are new problems. It’s a topic near and dear to my heart, something I wrote about in the closing chapter of [<cite>Adaptive Web Design’s</cite> Second Edition](http://adaptivewebdesign.info/2nd-edition/) and [recently spoke about at EnhanceConf in London](/notebook/learn-from-the-past-enhance-for-the-future/). He knocked this one out of the park and my head was nodding so much my neck began to hurt.

Next up was [my former WaSP colleague](http://www.webstandards.org/about/members/) [Rachel Andrew](https://rachelandrew.co.uk/) to give us the skinny on CSS Grid Layouts. This is an amazing spec that I’ve always struggled to understand fully (despite the fact that’s i’ve written a Javascript polyfill for it). Rachel made it crystal clear and got me very excited about the future of layout on the Web.

[Jen Simmons](http://jensimmons.com/) dropped some serious CSS-related design knowledge bombs that perfectly complimented Rachel’s talk. She discussed Flexbox, CSS Shapes, Multi-column layout, viewport units and more, demonstrating how they can be used right now to progressively enhance the design of your sites.

After lunch, [Brad Frost](http://bradfrost.com/) took to the stage to talk about Style Guides. I only caught the last half—I’ll admit to doing some last-minute rehearsing in the hallway—but the bits I did catch were good. I’ve seen his Atomic Design talk a few times, which this one builds on. In this talk he touches on a lot of the atomic design concepts, but he also talked a lot more about workflow and the role of the front-end developer. No doubt the evolution of this talk has come in large part through writing [a book on Atomic Design](http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/) and in hosting [a podcast with Anna Debenham on website style guides](http://styleguides.io/podcast/).

Next, I was given the opportunity to share some thoughts and advice on designing and building. My talk, *The Features of Highly Effective Forms*, evolved out of several earlier talks on building forms. With this one, I wanted to strike a little more balance between the nuts and bolts of building forms and the hows and whys of building better forms.

The deck, [which I’ve posted to SlideShare](http://www.slideshare.net/AaronGustafson/the-features-of-highly-effective-forms-an-event-apart-nashville-2016), doesn’t stand on its own quite as well as some of my other forms decks simply because the talk contained a lot of storytelling I chose not to pair with slides—instead opting for an black screen so folks could focus—but I did call out the salient points. I’ve begun writing up some of the recommendations as part of my [Modern Web Forms Best Practices series](/notebook/tags/web-forms/) and will continue to do so in the future. And one of the stories I told, which I highly recommend you check out, had to do with [a lesson Facebook learned in managing how users report offensive photos](/notebook/consider-how-your-forms-read/).

[Josh Clark](https://bigmedium.com/) wrapped the day up with a discussion of the future of interface as things move from digital back to physical. He talked about a lot of really cool new tech that has me excited about the future, including [the Physical Web](https://google.github.io/physical-web/), which Josh had running as a live demo. I wonder if anyone noticed I had a beacon running too ;-)

All in all, day one was a blast. As always, Jeffrey, Eric, [Toby](https://www.linkedin.com/in/toby-malina-6247a028), and [Marci](http://www.escapadeproductions.com/) do an awesome job programming their events. I’m really bummed I could not stick around to see [Val](http://valhead.com/), [Jason](https://twitter.com/grigs), [Krystal](http://www.kryshiggins.com/), [Eric](http://meyerweb.com/), [Kristina](http://braintraffic.com/), and [Cameron](http://cameronmoll.com/) rock it out though. I’m sure it was amazing.

You can check out attendees thoughts from the event by [searching Twitter using the #aeansh hashtag](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23aeansh&src=typd). I’ve [collected reactions to my talk on Storify](https://storify.com/AaronGustafson/reactions-and-takeaways-from-my-aeansh-talk) for posterity as well.
