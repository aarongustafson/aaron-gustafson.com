This project—from a Swedish student—seeks to address the issue of the dominance of "whiteness" online by asking you to share pictures of non-white hands in order to make them more visible in Google Image Search. Admittedly, it’s a drop in the bucket when it comes to increasing the visibility of colored people online, but as Ovid famously said: “Dripping water hollows out stone, not through force but through persistence” (<i lang="la">Gutta cavat lapidem, non vi, sed saepe cadendo</i>).
