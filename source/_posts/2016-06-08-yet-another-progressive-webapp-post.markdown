An excellent post from Ada Rose Edwards on Progressive Web Apps. She’s brings up some very real concerns, many of which I share:

* The basis for what Chrome defines as a Web App is based upon a set of technology rather than a set of features.
* We need to consider carefully before we throw away URLs or the entire browser chrome in an effort to look like and behave like the cool kids of native.
* The install banner is the browser manufacturers’ choice; it’s not a spec.
