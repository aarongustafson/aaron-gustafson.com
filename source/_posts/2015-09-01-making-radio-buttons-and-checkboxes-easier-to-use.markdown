Experiments in radio and checkbox resizing. It’s a sad state of affairs. The small hit targets are why I recommend adding negative margins above and below the `label`, coupled with equal padding top and bottom. It’s a recommendation from [my forms talk](http://www.aaron-gustafson.com/notebook/slides-from-my-talk-at-number-msedgesummit/) that I will write up soon.
