I’m so incredibly excited about this! Highlights:

* The accessibility tree is no longer a subtree of the DOM;
* ARIA Landmarks and document structure navigation;
* Proper computing of accessible name & description;
* Improved error validity states;
* Accessible `datalist`, improved `select`, and improvements to all list type elements;
* Keyboard controls for the number field;
* Accessible `input[type=color]`;
* Improved high contrast mode (no more removing background images, instead, the image stays and a solid color is placed behind the text);
* Speech synthesis API;
* An improved caret on Windows Phone when using an external keyboard; and
* So much more.

Couple this with the F12 dev tools enhancements and Narrator’s Developer Mode and it’s pretty clear how committed Microsoft is to accessibility. I’m so glad I work here!
