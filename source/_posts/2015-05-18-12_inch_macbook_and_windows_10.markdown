This was in interesting read from [Alex King](https://twitter.com/Alex_V_King). My favorite quote?

> [I]t's ironic that in some regards, the new MacBook runs Windows 10 (a prerelease version, at that) better than it runs OS X. But it's a testament to two things: Apple's fantastic MacBook hardware, which is forward-thinking yet surprisingly agile; and Microsoft's excellent Windows software, which entices and excites with its beautiful interface, useful new features, and rock-solid UI transitions.

I have Windows 10 running in a VM. I haven’t tried it as a Bootcamp partition yet, but Alex’s finding are intriguing.
