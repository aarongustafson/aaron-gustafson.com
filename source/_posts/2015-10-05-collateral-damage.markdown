Just like JavaScript, CSS, and images, you are not guaranteed that your web fonts are going to reach (or be appreciated by) your users. I know I constantly run into web font-related performance issues with *Wired* on my iPhone, even on a speedy WiFi connection, so I’m not at all surprised users are looking to block them.

How do you deal with this? Don’t hide your content until the fonts arrive. Assume they never will.
