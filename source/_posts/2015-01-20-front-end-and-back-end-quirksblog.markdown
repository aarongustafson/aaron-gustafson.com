PPK nails it as usual:

> Back-enders work with only one environment, their server. They have the option of changing their environment; for instance by installing new software or upgrading the hardware.

> Front-enders work with an unknown number of radically different environments, ranging from state-of-the-art desktop computer to three-year-old, crappy phones with limited memory and processor time. They cannot change these environments because they have no power over their usersâ€™ browsers. Still, their code should work in all of them.

I shared similar thoughts in my post [A Fundamental Disconnect](http://aaron-gustafson.com/notebook/a-fundamental-disconnect/).
