Since re-starting my blog I’ve been continuing to tinker with Octopress and Jekyll in an effort to customize things a bit more to my liking.

I recently began posting links (with commentary) in a bit of a link blog, but I wasn’t really happy with having it mixed in with the rest of my Notebook posts. I finally took a few minutes to formally bust out the links into [their own paginated section](/notebook/links/), so you can keep up with them independently. I also set up a three distinct Atom feeds to let you consume this site’s content how you want to: [Latest 20 posts and links](/atom.xml), [latest 20 posts](/atom-latest-posts.xml), and [Latest 20 links](/atom-latest-links.xml).

I’m hopeful this organization will prove as helpful to you as it is for my compartmentalization anxiety.
