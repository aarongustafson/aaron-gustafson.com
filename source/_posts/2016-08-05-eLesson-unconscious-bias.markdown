I loved taking this course as part of my job training at Microsoft and I’m so excited that they’ve made it public. I learned a ton and I’m sure you will too:

> In this course, you'll deepen your understanding of unconscious biases, how they influence behavior, and how they impact us all. You'll also learn numerous actions you can take to help counter bias in your own work environment.
