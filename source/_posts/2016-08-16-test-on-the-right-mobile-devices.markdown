This is a nice overview of where you should be spending your mobile device testing time if you’re clueless about where to begin. Obviously it skews toward BrowserStack’s offerings, but it’s a pretty solid list of devices. It doesn’t touch on browsers though, which means Opera is a glaring omission.
