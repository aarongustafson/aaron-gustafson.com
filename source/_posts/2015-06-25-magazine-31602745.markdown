A good overview of why the “hamburger” can’t stand alone.

> "I did multiple tests," says James Foster, a web developer based in New Zealand, who has surveyed users' interactions with the button over the course of many months. "The results all came out the same—the icon is not as clear to some users as developers and designers think it is."

> Adding the word "menu" underneath the three lines increases the button's use by 7.2%, according to Foster's tests.

> Putting the hamburger inside a box, so it looks like a button, increases use by 22.4%.

> Switching the lines for the word "menu" makes 20% more people click, Foster found.
