A good overview of why the “hamburger” can’t stand alone.

> "I did multiple tests," says James Foster, a web developer based in New Zealand, who has surveyed users' interactions with the button over the course of many months. "The results all came out the same - the icon is not as clear to some users as developers and designers think it is."

> Adding the word "menu" underneath the three lines increases the button's use by 7.2%, according to Foster's tests.

> Putting the hamburger inside a box, so it looks like a button, increases use by 22.4%.

> Switching the lines for the word "menu" makes 20% more people click, Foster found.
