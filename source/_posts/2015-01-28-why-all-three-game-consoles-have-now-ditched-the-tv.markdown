I hadn’t really thought about it with respect to gaming, but this has definitely been an interesting trend:

> More and more so, the programming we once watched on TV is migrating to our tablets and phones. Cable providers have apps that let customers access live television, and even the contents of their DVRs, on their personal devices.
