I am not a WhatsApp user, but I have long been impressed with the way they embrace operating systems others ignore. I think it has been a key to their success and speaks to the "accessibility" (in the broader sense) of their service.

I am completely baffled by the design decisions they made in their Web client, as is Andre Alves Garzia.
