Matt offers us a nice round-up of new selectors that will likely be a part of the [CSS 4 Selectors Module](http://dev.w3.org/csswg/selectors-4/). Notable additions:

* [`:has`](https://grack.com/blog/2015/01/11/css-selectors-4/#has) - select an element based on children it contains,
* [`:matches`](https://grack.com/blog/2015/01/11/css-selectors-4/#matches) - a more compact way to select elements via alternate selector paths,
* [`:not()` in a stack](https://grack.com/blog/2015/01/11/css-selectors-4/#not) - lets you combine multiple selectors not to match, using commas.
* [Column selection](https://grack.com/blog/2015/01/11/css-selectors-4/#column-combinator--and-nth-column)
