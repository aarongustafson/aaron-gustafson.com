It is with a heavy heart that I announce that we are closing [*Web Standards Sherpa*](http://webstandardssherpa.com/). As of April 2, we will be archiving the site in order to keep the valuable insights and techniques shared by our authors available in perpetuity.

I am sure I speak for [our staff and authors](http://webstandardssherpa.com/about/#staff) when I say this has been a wonderful experience and we are incredibly proud of the work we have done. The [reviews and articles we’ve written](http://webstandardssherpa.com/reviews/) and [the questions we’ve answered](http://webstandardssherpa.com/ask-the-sherpas/) have provided web designers and developers around the world with relevant, actionable information to help them do their jobs better. And I have no doubt that our readers have helped make the Web better by improving the quality of the products our industry produces.

As one last hurrah—and as a way to raise some funds to pay for the site’s archival & internment—we are collaborating with [Environments for Humans](http://environmentsforhumans.com/) to put on [a one-day live virtual conference](http://environmentsforhumans.com/2015/web-sherpa-summit/) featuring a handful of our writers and staff giving talks and answering your questions.

I am very thankful to [all of our staff and authors](http://webstandardssherpa.com/about/#staff) and to you, our readers, for making *Web Standards Sherpa* such a fun and rewarding endeavor! It was a great run and I count myself lucky to have had a small hand in the creation of so much great content.

You can find all of the details regarding the conference [over on the Environments for Humans website](http://environmentsforhumans.com/2015/web-sherpa-summit/). I hope you’ll consider attending so we can ensure *Web Standards Sherpa*’s excellent content will remain available for years to come. Use the discount code SHERPA to save 20% off of the ticket price.
