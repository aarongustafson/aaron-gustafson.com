Insurance company [Unum](http://www.unum.com/) has just released the "UX Toolkits" (a.k.a. patten libraries) they use for both Unum and Colonial Life. They are pretty bare-bones right now, but I am hopeful they will flesh them out over time.

* [Colonial Life UX Toolkit](http://toolkit.coloniallifeux.com)

I love it when companies share stuff like this.
