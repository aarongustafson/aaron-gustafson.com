I harp on this a lot: You can never trust the client (as in “the browser”). In this case, Joomla was not sanitizing User Agent strings before storing them in the database, [opening a garage door-sized security hole](https://developer.joomla.org/security-centre/630-20151214-core-remote-code-execution-vulnerability.html).
