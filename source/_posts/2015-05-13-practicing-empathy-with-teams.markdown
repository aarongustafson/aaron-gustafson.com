I’ve touched on this a bit in my [Designing with Empathy](http://www.slideshare.net/AaronGustafson/designing-with-empathy-reasons-to-be-creative-2013) presentation: “Empathy is just as important for us to practice as we interact with our team members”. [Susan Robertson](https://twitter.com/susanjrobertson) goes into the topic of empathy building for teams in this great post for <cite>A List Apart</cite>.
