As usual, Jason Grigsby nails it:

* Progressive Web Apps still work on iOS
* Progressive Web Apps perform better on iOS
* Billions of people use browsers that support Progressive Web Apps
* Apple appears to be warming to Progressive Web App technology
* Progressive Web Apps benefit all users

Done and done.
