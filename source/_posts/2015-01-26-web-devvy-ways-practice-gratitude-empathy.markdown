A great post from Chris Coyier:

>  I'm starting to think empathy really is one of the most valuable skills (if you can call it a skill) that you can have. If you can put yourself in another persons shoes, you can imagine what it's like to use the things you make. That gives you mad UX skills. It means you can write a damn fine support email. You can make a meeting worth having. You can communicate clearly, because you can imagine what it's like to receive that communication.

Empathy is where itâ€™s at. Check out his list for ways to increase your "devvy" empathy.
