The highlights:

* Scroll snapping (see also [David Storey’s write-up](http://generatedcontent.org/post/66817675443/setting-native-like-scrolling-offsets-in-css-with) on this)
* Some ECMAScript 6
* CSS Filters
* Removing some vendor prefixes

The yawners:

* Pinned sites
* Force touch
* HTML Video picture in picture

Overall I’m kind of <i>meh</i> on the updates. I was hoping for more.
