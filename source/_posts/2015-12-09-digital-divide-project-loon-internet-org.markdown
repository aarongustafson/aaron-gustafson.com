An excellent call to arms for reaching the underserved. When you need to center yourself with respect to your place in the world, consider these stats:

> When you take a step back and look beyond the U.S., more than two-thirds of the world’s population does not have Internet access. The World Bank’s research estimates that poverty hits 700 million people in our world, which is defined as $1.90 a day or less, or 9.6% of the global population. Also 1.2 billion people (22%) live on less than $1.25 a day, and among these people just under half have electricity.
