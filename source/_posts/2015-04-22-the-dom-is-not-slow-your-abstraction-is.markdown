Abstraction can be helpful, but it also complicates things and leads to slower performance. [Andrea Giammarchi](https://twitter.com/WebReflection) provides lots of details here in examining a complex app scenario with the good old fashioned DOM vs. a handful of frameworks. Bonus points for the fact that most of the video evidence tests are being run on non-iOS devices!

> No, the DOM is not your problem, the fact you brought an over-engineered abstraction on top of a deadly simple task, like a table that needs some quick update, is the real problem you don't want to see.
