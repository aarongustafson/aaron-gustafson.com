Some semi-locals (<abbr aria-label="Atlanta">ATL</abbr> is only 2 hours from <abbr aria-label="Chattanooga">Chatty</abbr>) look to be taking on the likes of [ReadSpeaker](http://www.readspeaker.com/) (who Iâ€™ve worked with on [<cite>Web Standards Sherpa</cite>](http://webstandardssherpa.com/)) in the automated HTML-to-spoken-word automation space. If [SpeakPage](https://speakpage.com/) can pull it off, this has some real potential.
