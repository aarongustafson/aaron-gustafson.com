I was honored when Sarah Horton and Whitney Quesenbery approached me to write [the foreword](http://blog.easy-designs.net/archives/a-web-for-everyone/) for this incredibly important book on accessibility. I highly recommend it to anyone looking to really understand what accessibility is all about and who is looking for inspiration for designing more inclusively.
