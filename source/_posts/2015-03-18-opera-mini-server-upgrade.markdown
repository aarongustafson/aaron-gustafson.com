The server-side Presto rendering engine that drives Opera Mini has gotten a major upgrade, introducing some great new features including

* [flexbox](http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-flexbox/)
* [rem units](http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-values/#rem-unit), and
* [a bit of ECMAScript 5](https://dev.opera.com/blog/opera-mini-server-upgrade/#ecmascript-5).

HTML5 input types are on the docket. They wonâ€™t be displayed properly in clients until they get an upgrade, but the parse is aware of them now and they will fall back to "text" inputs until the client roll-out happens.
