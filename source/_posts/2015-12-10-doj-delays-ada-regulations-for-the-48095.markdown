The [U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) already affirmed that Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) applies to the websites of private businesses](https://www.aaron-gustafson.com/notebook/harvard-and-mit-and-captioning/). They initiated the rule-making process in 2010, but have now delayed regulations around its application until 2018. The DoJ says it’s because they want to tackle Title II (which applies to government agencies and contractors) first. But 3 more years? Seriously?! C’mon now!
