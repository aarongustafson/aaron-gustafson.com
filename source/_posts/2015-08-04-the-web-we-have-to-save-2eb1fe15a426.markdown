This is a wonderful celebration of the hyperlink and the beauty of the decentralized web in a world of social media sites vying to keep us in their walled gardens. Hossein Derakhshan’s perspective is an interesting one as he’d been in prison (for blogging) since 2008.

> Nearly every social network now treats a link as just the same as it treats any other object — the same as a photo, or a piece of text — instead of seeing it as a way to make that text richer. You’re encouraged to post one single hyperlink and expose it to a quasi-democratic process of liking and plussing and hearting: Adding several links to a piece of text is usually not allowed. Hyperlinks are objectivized, isolated, stripped of their powers.
