I love, love, love this talk from [Niels Leenheer](https://twitter.com/rakaz) at [Frontend NE](https://frontendne.co.uk). He covers TV browsers, game consoles, handheld consoles, e-readers, and VR headsets and talks about what we can, canâ€™t, and should try to do to accommodate them.

You can also [watch Niels give this talk on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojGIva5801I).
