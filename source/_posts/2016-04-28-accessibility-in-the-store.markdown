Apps in the [Windows Store](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/apps) can now be flagged as accessible on submission. Not sure if anyone is validating these claims, but my guess is that they will if it becomes abused. Regardless, Iâ€™m excited to see Microsoft take this step to make it easier for folks who need it to find accessible apps.
