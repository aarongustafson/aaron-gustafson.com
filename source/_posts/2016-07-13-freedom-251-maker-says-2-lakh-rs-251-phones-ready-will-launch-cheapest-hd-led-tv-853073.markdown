The world's cheapest smartphone (251 Indian Rupeesâ€”less than US$4) is here. The specs:

* 4-inch screen
* dual-SIM
*  3G
*  1.3GHz quad-core processor
*  1GB of RAM
*  8GB of internal storage (supporting memory cards of up to 32GB)
*  8-megapixel rear camera with flash
*  3.2-megapixel front camera
*  1800mAh battery
*  Android 5.1 (Lollipop)

[The rollout is slow and units are being sold at a loss](http://tech.firstpost.com/news-analysis/ringing-bells-has-actually-shipped-5000-freedom-251-devices-but-critics-need-not-apologise-324579.html), but still. This is amazing and the program, which is [subsidized by the Indian government](http://tech.firstpost.com/news-analysis/freedom-251-2-lakh-units-to-be-shipped-via-state-wise-lucky-draw-between-30-june-to-5-july-322588.html), will bring the web to millions who have not been able to access it previously.
