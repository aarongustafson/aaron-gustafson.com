This is an excellent missive from Nicholas covering the progressive enhancement debate.

> First … progressive enhancement isn't about having a JavaScript vs. JavaScript-disabled experience, it's about providing the best possible user experience throughout the entire lifecycle of the web application. …

> Second, progressive enhancement isn't a strict prescription, it's a way of thinking about the software you're building. … Instead, it encourages you to think more deeply about the problem you're trying to solve, and guides you towards solutions that work for the maximum number of users. 

> These two points are why I believe progressive enhancement is as relevant today as it has ever been. The only difference now is that we have more options for improving the user experience than ever before.

I couldn’t have said it better myself.
