And here we have yet another new browser. Vivaldi is inspired by the Opera of old and is pretty feature-rich according to the article. Iâ€™ll give it a shot.

Vivaldi runs Blink under the hood (like Opera and Chrome), which lends credence to my theory that [soon browsers will compete on chrome, rather than standards implementations](/notebook/competing-on-chrome/).
