The recommendation of IE over Edge may seem strange, but there’s a reason: Microsoft is changing APIs from MSAA (Microsoft Active Accessibility) to UIA (UI Automation) and it’s a work in progress. Consequently, the Microsoft Edge browser is not as accessible as the team would like it to be… yet. But, as [Jacob Rossi covered in response to Steve Faulkner](http://www.paciellogroup.com/blog/2015/07/a11y-slackers/#comment-2344), it’s coming and the end result will be far better for folks who rely on assistive technology.
