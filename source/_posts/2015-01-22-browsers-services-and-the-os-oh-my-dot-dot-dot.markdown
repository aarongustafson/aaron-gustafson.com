[Christian Heilmann](http://christianheilmann.com)’s take on [yesterday’s IE announcement](http://news.microsoft.com/windows10story/), including a bit of historical context and a look toward the future of browsers killing stand-alone apps.

> For me, however, the whole thing was a bit of an epiphany about browsers. I’ve always seen browsers as my main playground and got frustrated by lack of standards support across them. I got annoyed by users not upgrading to new ones or companies making that hard. And I was disappointed by developers having their pet browsers to support and demand people to use the same. What I missed out on was how amazing browsers themselves have become as tools for end users.
