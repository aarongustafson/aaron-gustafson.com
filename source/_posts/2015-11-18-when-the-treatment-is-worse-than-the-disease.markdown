Karl nails it (as per usual): 

> [A]dd-on accessibility is a sham. … They fail to provide anything beyond a marginal benefit for the end user and are, at best, a band-aid over a gaping wound. … [Companies] would be better off spending their money educating their design and development staff on accessibility than wasting their money on snake oil solutions made by amateurs.
