This is an interesting finding in the realm of accessibility: <abbr aria-label="the Accessible Rich Internet Applications spec">ARIA</abbr> being harmful to the experience. As I understand it, the <abbr aria-label="Web Accessibility Initiative">WAI</abbr>’s recommended interaction and tab flow stems from the way people using <abbr aria-label="assistive technology">AT</abbr> would tab through traditional desktop interfaces (<abbr aria-label="for example">e.g.</abbr>, Windows). I wonder if, as more people use the Web as their primary means of interacting with software, those mappings have become less relevant, either through loss of muscle memory in the case of long-time <abbr aria-label="assistive technology">AT</abbr> users or a lack of awareness for those who’ve only used <abbr aria-label="assistive technology">AT</abbr> since the advent of the Web and Web-based interactions (<abbr aria-label="in other words">i.e.</abbr>, folks who’ve never had to navigate their way through complex interfaces like Windows’ Device Manager).
