My old friend Jason Garber—who I, sadly, haven’t seen in probably a decade—came up with a great list of "professional self-improvement tips for anyone working on the Web today". I’ll give you the synopses, but you should do yourself a favor and read the full post for the background:

1. Know Your History
2. Know Your Medium
3. Respect Those Who Came Before You
4. Respect Your Audience
5. Get Involved

I would absolutely echo these to anyone looking to become (or improve as) a web professional.
