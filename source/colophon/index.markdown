# Colophon

So you want to know more about what makes this site tick, huh? Well, it’s powered by [Octopress](http://octopress.org/), a Jekyll-based blogging engine created by [Brandon Mathis](http://twitter.com/imathis). The site is hosted on [Github](https://github.com) and published via [Github pages](https://pages.github.com/).

No frameworks were used in the creation of this site. I did use [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) to help me with my CSS workflow and use the [Susy](http://susy.oddbird.net/), [Breakup](https://github.com/BPScott/breakup), and [Quantity Query](https://github.com/danielguillan/quantity-queries) add-ins. I also use the [HTML5 Doctor CSS reset](http://html5doctor.com/html-5-reset-stylesheet/). I have a couple of [Gulp scripts](https://github.com/aarongustafson/aarongustafson.github.io/tree/source/gulp) I use to manage my builds. I also created a handful of [custom Rake commands](https://github.com/aarongustafson/aarongustafson.github.io/blob/source/Rakefile#L412) to assist me in building and maintaining the site.

In terms of Jekyll/Octopress plug-ins, I use [Category Generator](https://github.com/imathis/octopress/blob/master/plugins/category_generator.rb), [Generate Sitemap](https://github.com/recurser/jekyll-plugins/blob/master/generate_sitemap.rb), and [Gist](https://gist.github.com/1027674). I [customized](https://github.com/aarongustafson/aarongustafson.github.io/blob/source/plugins/youtube.rb) [Etienne Rossignon’s lazy loading YouTube plugin](https://github.com/erossignon/jekyll-youtube-lazyloading) and [adapted it for Vimeo](https://github.com/aarongustafson/aarongustafson.github.io/blob/source/plugins/vimeo.rb) as well. I also wrote [a plugin for handling web mentions using Webmention.io](https://github.com/aarongustafson/jekyll-webmention_io) ([blog post](/notebook/enabling-webmentions-in-jekyll/)), [one for adaptive images](https://github.com/aarongustafson/jekyll-adaptive-image), and site-specific generators for [the main blog](https://github.com/aarongustafson/aarongustafson.github.io/blob/source/plugins/notebook_generator.rb) and [my linkblog](https://github.com/aarongustafson/aarongustafson.github.io/blob/source/plugins/octopress_filters.rb). My [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) documents are parsed with [rdiscount](https://github.com/davidfstr/rdiscount).

Typography-wise, I am using [Prenton](https://typekit.com/fonts/prenton) by [BluHead Studio](http://new.myfonts.com/foundry/BluHead_Studio/) for body copy. Headlines are set in [Quatro Slab](https://typekit.com/fonts/quatro-slab) by [p.s.type](http://cargocollective.com/pstype). Inline code is set in [Inconsolata](https://typekit.com/fonts/inconsolata) by [Raph Levien](http://www.levien.com/). Custom fonts are served by [Typekit](https://typekit.com).

The full source of this site is [available on Github](https://github.com/aarongustafson/aarongustafson.github.io/tree/source).
